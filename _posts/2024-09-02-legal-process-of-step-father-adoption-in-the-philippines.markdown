<p>Step-father adoption is a legal process in the Philippines that allows a stepfather to legally adopt his spouse's child from a previous relationship. This process is governed by the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998 (Republic Act No. 8552) and involves several legal steps to ensure the welfare and best interests of the child.</p><p>The first step in the process is to file a petition for adoption with the Regional Trial Court in the jurisdiction where the adopting stepfather and the child reside. This petition should include all necessary documents, such as the marriage certificate of the adopting parent and the biological parent, the birth certificate of the child, and the written consent of the biological parent and the child (if the child is 10 years old or older).</p><p>Once the petition is filed, the court will conduct a series of hearings to determine whether the adoption is in the best interest of the child. The court may also order a social worker from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to conduct a home study and provide a report on the suitability of the adoption. During this process, the biological father (if known and living) must be notified and given an opportunity to contest the adoption. If the biological father consents to the adoption or if his consent is waived due to abandonment or other legal reasons, the adoption process can proceed.</p><p>Upon the court's approval of the adoption, a new birth certificate will be issued for the child, reflecting the adoptive father's name as the legal father. The child will then enjoy all the rights of a legitimate child of the adopting parent, including the right to inherit from the stepfather.</p><p>It is important to note that the adoption process can be legally complex and may involve significant legal fees. Therefore, it is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer experienced in family law to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with all legal requirements.</p>
