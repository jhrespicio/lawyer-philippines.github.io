<p>In the Philippines, verifying the details of a judicial case, including the case number and branch number, is possible through the judicial offices where the case is filed. When a request is made to verify a case, the judiciary may provide information about all cases associated with the individual, including pending and most recent cases. The process typically involves submitting a formal request or petition to the appropriate court or judicial office, accompanied by valid identification and relevant case details. The verification process is essential for individuals involved in legal proceedings to ensure accurate and up-to-date information regarding their cases. It is also crucial for due diligence, particularly in legal, employment, or business contexts where the background of involved parties needs to be thoroughly checked.</p>
