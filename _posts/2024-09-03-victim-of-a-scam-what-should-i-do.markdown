<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I sent money to someone pretending to sell something, but they disappeared after I sent the payment. What steps should I take to address this scam?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Being a victim of a scam is unfortunate, but there are legal steps you can take to seek justice. First, report the incident to the nearest police station or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division if the scam occurred online. Provide all evidence, including communications, receipts, and any other relevant information. You may also file a formal complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) if it involves a business transaction. Additionally, consider pursuing a case for estafa (fraud) under the Revised Penal Code, which penalizes deceitful actions causing another person to suffer damage or loss. Engaging a lawyer to assist with the legal process is recommended to ensure your rights are protected and to increase the chances of recovering your money or getting justice.</p>
