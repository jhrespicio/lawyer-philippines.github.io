<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> Can negative comments against someone on Facebook be considered cyberbullying?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Under Republic Act No. 10175, also known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, cyberbullying can fall under online libel if it involves malicious and defamatory remarks intended to harm someoneâ€™s reputation. If negative comments on Facebook are personal attacks that cause harm to someone's dignity, emotional well-being, or reputation, they could be classified as cyberbullying or cyber libel. The key factor is whether the statements were made with malice and have caused or intended to cause harm. Victims can file complaints with the police or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division.</p>
