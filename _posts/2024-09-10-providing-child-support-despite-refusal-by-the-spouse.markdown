<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am separated from my spouse, and I want to provide financial support for our children. However, my spouse refuses to accept the support. I am worried that this might cause legal problems for me in the future. What should I do to ensure that I am fulfilling my legal obligations?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Even if your spouse refuses to accept the support, you are still legally obligated to provide for your children. The Family Code of the Philippines mandates that parents must support their children. You can send the support through other means, such as opening a bank account in your childrenâ€™s name or providing the support directly to them if they are of legal age. It is advisable to keep receipts or proof of these transactions to protect yourself from any future legal claims. Should your spouse refuse to cooperate, you may seek assistance from the court to formalize the child support arrangement, which could ensure that your legal obligations are recognized.</p>
