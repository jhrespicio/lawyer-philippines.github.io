<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am preparing a complaint related to bullying, specifically under the topic of anti-bullying. What laws and legal provisions can support my case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The Philippines has laws to protect individuals from bullying, particularly under the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10627). This law applies mostly to schools, but workplace bullying or bullying in other contexts may be covered by other laws such as the Safe Spaces Act (Republic Act No. 11313), which protects individuals from harassment in both public and online spaces. Depending on the circumstances, complaints may be filed for unjust vexation or even under the Cybercrime Prevention Act if the bullying involves online harassment. You should carefully document all incidents and consider which law best fits the specifics of your case.</p>
