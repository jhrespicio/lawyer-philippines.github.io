<p>Illegal detention is a serious offense in the Philippines. The Constitution guarantees that a person who is arrested must be charged within a certain period, typically 12 to 36 hours depending on the gravity of the offense, as stipulated under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code. If a person is detained beyond this period without formal charges being filed, it constitutes arbitrary detention, which is punishable by law. The victim can file a complaint against the arresting officers for violating their rights. Additionally, the detainee can file a petition for habeas corpus to demand their release or to compel the authorities to justify the detention in court.</p>
