<p>The Philippines' Republic Act No. 9262, also known as the Violence Against Women and Their Children (VAWC) Act, provides strong legal protection for women and children against abuse. Offenders who are abroad, including Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), can still face legal consequences, including deportation, if charged with VAWC. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), in coordination with Philippine embassies and consulates, may assist in the repatriation of the accused for prosecution. Additionally, under international agreements, a host country may deport individuals who have committed serious offenses in their home country. Victims of VAWC residing in the Philippines or abroad are encouraged to file a complaint with the appropriate authorities, such as the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). The government ensures that protective orders and legal remedies are available to safeguard the rights of victims, regardless of the offender's location.</p>
