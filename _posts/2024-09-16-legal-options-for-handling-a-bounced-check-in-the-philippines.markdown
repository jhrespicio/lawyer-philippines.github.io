<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I issued a check that has bounced due to insufficient funds. I want to understand the legal consequences of this and what actions I can take to resolve the issue. What should I expect in terms of penalties, and are there ways to settle this without going to court?<br><br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, specifically the Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (BP 22), issuing a check without sufficient funds is a punishable offense. You may be held liable for either a civil or criminal case. The penalty for a violation of BP 22 can include a fine or imprisonment, but courts usually lean towards fines for first-time offenders.<br>If you wish to resolve the matter amicably, you can approach the payee to settle the amount due before they initiate legal proceedings. A compromise agreement where you settle the debt and related costs could prevent a court case. However, failure to settle could result in legal action being filed against you in court, which may include criminal charges or a civil complaint to recover the debt. It is advisable to pay the outstanding amount promptly to avoid further complications.</p>
