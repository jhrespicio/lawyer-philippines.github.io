<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Can you explain what “free bargaining” means in a legal context? I’ve come across this term and would like to understand its implications for labor and contractual agreements.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>“Free bargaining” refers to the right of individuals, particularly in the labor sector, to negotiate terms and conditions of employment without undue interference. It is a fundamental right in labor law that allows workers, either individually or through collective bargaining units like labor unions, to negotiate with employers on wages, working hours, benefits, and other employment conditions. In the Philippines, this right is protected under the Labor Code and various international labor conventions. It is crucial in ensuring that both employees and employers engage in fair and equitable negotiations. However, this does not mean that any demand will be granted, as negotiations should be reasonable and based on mutual consent.</p>
