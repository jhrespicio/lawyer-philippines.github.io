<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I signed a Deed of Absolute Sale, but no payment was made. The buyer claims that it was for BIR purposes only. Do I have the right to cancel the Deed of Absolute Sale?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, a Deed of Absolute Sale is a binding contract that transfers ownership of the property once signed by both parties. However, for the sale to be valid, there must be consideration, usually in the form of payment. If no payment has been made, the seller can argue that the sale is void or voidable for lack of consideration. You may have the right to cancel the Deed if you can prove that no payment was made and that the buyer had no intention of paying. Additionally, any misrepresentation, such as using the Deed solely for BIR purposes, could be grounds for annulment under the Civil Code. To formally cancel the Deed, it is advisable to consult a lawyer to draft the necessary legal documentation and file for proper rescission of the sale in court.</p>
