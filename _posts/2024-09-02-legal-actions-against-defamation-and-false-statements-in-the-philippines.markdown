<p>In the Philippines, defamation, or the act of making false statements that harm another person's reputation, is punishable under the Revised Penal Code. Defamation can take the form of libel, which is committed through written means, or slander, which is committed through spoken words. Under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code, libel is defined as the public and malicious imputation of a crime, vice, defect, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance that tends to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a person.</p><p>Individuals who believe they have been defamed can file a criminal complaint for libel or slander, depending on the medium used to spread the defamatory statements. Libel cases are often filed in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) where the defamatory statement was printed, exhibited, or circulated. The complainant must prove that the statement was made with malice, was directed at them, and caused damage to their reputation.</p><p>Additionally, under Republic Act No. 10175, known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, online defamation is also punishable. This includes defamatory statements made on social media platforms or other digital means. Victims of online defamation may also file a civil case for damages to recover compensation for any harm suffered due to the false statements.</p><p>It is crucial to gather evidence, such as screenshots or recordings, and to seek legal counsel to properly navigate the process of filing a defamation case. The law protects individuals from false and malicious statements, and pursuing legal action is a means to restore one's reputation and hold the defamer accountable.</p>
