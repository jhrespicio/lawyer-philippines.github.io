<p>Libel, as defined under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, refers to the public and malicious imputation of a crime, vice, or defect that causes dishonor, discredit, or contempt to a person. In the context of private communications, such as messaging apps like Messenger, the question of whether a statement is libelous depends on several factors, including the content and the recipient's status. For instance, if someone sends a message saying, 'kung may isip ka' ('if you have a brain') to a Barangay Captain, the statement could potentially be seen as offensive or disrespectful. However, for it to qualify as libel, it must be proven that the statement was made with malice and that it was intended to malign or damage the reputation of the recipient. Public officials, like a Barangay Captain, are subject to a higher threshold for libel, as they are expected to endure more criticism than private individuals. Nonetheless, if the statement is part of a broader campaign of harassment or is shared publicly beyond the private message, it could give rise to a libel case. The key elements of defamation, including malice, publication, and the defamatory nature of the statement, must be thoroughly examined.</p>
