<p>Harassment by online lending companies is a growing concern in the Philippines. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) and other relevant laws provide mechanisms for individuals to file complaints against these companies for unfair practices, such as threatening or harassing borrowers and their contacts. The National Privacy Commission (NPC) has issued warnings and imposed penalties on online lenders who violate the Data Privacy Act of 2012 by unlawfully accessing and using personal information. Victims of harassment can file a complaint with the NPC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or law enforcement agencies to take legal action against these companies. It is crucial for individuals facing such issues to document all instances of harassment and seek legal counsel to understand their rights and the appropriate course of action.</p>
