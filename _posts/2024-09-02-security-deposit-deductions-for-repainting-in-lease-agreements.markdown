<p>In the Philippines, the security deposit in a lease agreement serves as a form of protection for the landlord against damages or unpaid dues. However, the landlord’s right to deduct from the security deposit should be clearly stipulated in the lease agreement. Repainting costs, unless explicitly agreed upon in the contract as a tenant’s responsibility, are typically considered normal wear and tear, which the landlord should not deduct from the security deposit. Any deductions not covered in the lease agreement could be contested by the tenant. The general rule is that security deposits should only be used for damages beyond normal wear and tear or for unpaid rent. Tenants have the right to demand a full accounting of the deductions made by the landlord and can file a complaint if they believe the deductions are unjustified.</p>
