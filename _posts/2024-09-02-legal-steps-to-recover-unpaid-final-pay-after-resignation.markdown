<p>When an employee resigns from a company, they are legally entitled to receive their final pay, which includes any unpaid salary, allowances, and benefits. However, there are instances when a company fails to release this payment in a timely manner. If a year has passed since your resignation and your final pay has not yet been released, it is crucial to take the appropriate legal steps to recover what is owed to you.</p><p>Firstly, it is recommended to send a formal demand letter to your former employer. This letter should clearly state your claim for the unpaid final pay and any other benefits due to you. It is important to keep a copy of this letter and any responses you receive as these documents may serve as evidence if you need to escalate the matter.</p><p>If the company still does not respond or fails to release your final pay, you may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). DOLE has the authority to mediate between employees and employers in disputes over unpaid wages and benefits. You may also consider filing a case for illegal withholding of wages before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). Given that you are currently working overseas, you may authorize a representative to act on your behalf in these proceedings.</p><p>In the event that you cannot settle the issue through mediation or administrative proceedings, you may need to pursue civil action against your former employer. Legal representation may be necessary to guide you through the process and ensure that your rights are protected.</p>
