<p>In the Philippines, child custody is primarily guided by the best interests of the child. When parents are separated, the Family Code of the Philippines stipulates that the custody of children under seven years of age is generally awarded to the mother. However, once the child reaches the age of seven, they have the right to choose which parent they wish to live with, unless the court finds the chosen parent unfit.</p><p>For parents seeking custody of their children from a former spouse, it is essential to file a petition for custody in the appropriate Family Court. The court will consider various factors, including the child’s age, health, emotional ties with each parent, and the parent’s ability to provide for the child’s needs. Additionally, the parent’s moral character and the living environment they can offer will be evaluated.</p><p>It is important to note that custody disputes can be emotionally taxing and legally complex. Therefore, seeking legal counsel is advisable to ensure that the rights and welfare of both the parent and the child are adequately protected. In cases where both parents are deemed fit, joint custody may be awarded, ensuring that both parents have a role in the upbringing of the child.</p>
