<p>Abortion in the Philippines is a highly controversial and legally restricted issue. Under the Revised Penal Code, abortion is illegal in all circumstances, with penalties for both the person undergoing the abortion and those assisting in it. Despite this, the issue of legalizing abortion has been a topic of ongoing debate, especially in the context of womenâ€™s rights, health concerns, and cases involving rape or severe fetal impairment. Advocates for legalization argue that criminalizing abortion leads to unsafe procedures and contributes to maternal mortality, whereas opponents emphasize the protection of unborn life. Any discussion on the potential legalization of abortion must consider the cultural, moral, and religious factors that heavily influence public opinion and legislative action in the Philippines. To date, no significant legislative progress has been made toward changing the existing laws, and abortion remains a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment.</p>
