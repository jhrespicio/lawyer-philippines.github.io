<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to ask if a Vice Mayor or a lawyer in the Philippines has the authority to officiate a wedding. Who are the authorized persons to solemnize a marriage?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, only specific individuals are authorized to solemnize marriages. According to the Family Code of the Philippines, those who can officiate a wedding include judges, mayors, priests, rabbis, ministers, or pastors of recognized churches or religious organizations. A Vice Mayor or a lawyer does not have the legal authority to officiate a marriage unless they are also duly appointed in one of the aforementioned capacities, such as a mayor. Therefore, a Vice Mayor or a lawyer cannot officiate a wedding.</p>
