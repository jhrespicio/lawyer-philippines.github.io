<p>The use of horns by vehicles, including trucks, is regulated under Philippine law to ensure road safety and minimize noise pollution. The Land Transportation and Traffic Code, as outlined in Republic Act No. 4136, sets forth specific rules regarding the use of vehicle horns. According to the law, horns should only be used as a necessary warning device to prevent accidents and should not be used indiscriminately or to create unnecessary noise.</p><p>For trucks and other large vehicles, the use of horns can be particularly disruptive due to their volume and pitch. The law emphasizes that horn use should be limited to situations where it is needed to alert other road users of the vehicle’s presence or to prevent a potential collision. Continuous or rapid relay horn blowing, which is commonly associated with aggressive driving behavior, is discouraged and can be subject to penalties.</p><p>In addition to national regulations, local government units (LGUs) may implement their own ordinances to further control horn use in specific areas, particularly in urban or residential zones. These ordinances may include designated ‘no horn’ zones or specific times when horn use is prohibited. Violations of these ordinances may result in fines or other penalties.</p><p>Drivers, especially those operating large vehicles like trucks, are encouraged to exercise discretion and follow these regulations to contribute to safer and quieter roads. Compliance with these rules not only promotes public safety but also reflects responsible and courteous driving practices.</p>
