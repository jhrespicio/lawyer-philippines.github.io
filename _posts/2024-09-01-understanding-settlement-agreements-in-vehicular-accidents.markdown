<p>Settlement agreements are a common method of resolving disputes arising from vehicular accidents in the Philippines. These agreements are typically reached between the parties involved, with or without the assistance of their legal representatives, and outline the terms for compensating the injured party or covering the damages incurred. Settlements can occur before a case is filed in court or even during the course of litigation. A well-drafted settlement agreement should clearly state the obligations of each party, including the amount of compensation, the payment schedule, and the waiver of further claims. It's important to note that once a settlement is agreed upon and signed, it generally bars any further legal action related to the accident. Therefore, parties should carefully consider the terms before entering into a settlement.</p>
