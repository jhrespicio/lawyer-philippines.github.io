<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I lost my TIN ID and forgot my TIN number. Can I ask for assistance in retrieving it? What should I do in this situation?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you lose your TIN ID and forget your TIN number, the first step is to visit the nearest Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) office with valid identification, such as a government-issued ID, for verification. The BIR can help you recover your TIN. You may also call the BIR contact center or use their online services to request assistance. It's important to remember that the TIN is a lifetime number, and once issued, it remains the same, even if you lose your ID. You can also request a replacement for the lost TIN card at the BIR office where your account is registered.</p>
