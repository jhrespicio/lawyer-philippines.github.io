<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Can I travel outside the country if I have a pending case but no derogatory record when checked with the Bureau of Immigration?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Having a pending case does not automatically prevent you from traveling outside the Philippines, unless a Hold Departure Order (HDO) has been issued against you by the court handling your case. The Bureau of Immigration will check for any HDOs or derogatory records when you attempt to travel. Since you mentioned that no derogatory record was found, you may be able to travel as long as the court has not imposed any travel restrictions. However, it is important to verify this with your legal counsel to ensure that there are no other conditions related to your case that could affect your ability to leave the country. Always inform the court if you intend to travel to avoid any legal complications.</p>
