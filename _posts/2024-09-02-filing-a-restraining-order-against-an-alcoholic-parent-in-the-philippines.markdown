<p>In the Philippines, the law provides mechanisms to protect individuals from harm, including those caused by family members. If a parent’s alcoholism is causing significant distress and endangering your mental health and well-being, you may seek legal remedies such as filing a restraining order. The Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9262) allows for protection orders to be issued in cases where a family member's behavior poses a threat to another family member's safety or mental health. To file for a restraining order, you must provide evidence of the harmful effects of the parent’s alcoholism, which could include verbal abuse, physical harm, or severe psychological distress. The court may issue a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) or a Permanent Protection Order (PPO), depending on the severity of the situation. It is advisable to seek legal counsel to guide you through the process and ensure that your rights are fully protected.</p>
