<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have been harassed by an online lending app. They have been sending me threatening messages and invading my privacy. What are my options for reporting this harassment?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, harassment by online lending platforms is prohibited under the Lending Company Regulation Act and the Data Privacy Act. You can report the harassment to the National Privacy Commission (NPC) if the app is violating your privacy by accessing your contacts or personal information without consent. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees lending companies and can investigate unethical practices. Filing a formal complaint with the NPC or the SEC will prompt an investigation. If the harassment is particularly egregious, you may also file a criminal complaint with local law enforcement authorities under the Anti-Cybercrime Law.</p>
