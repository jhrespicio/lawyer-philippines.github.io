<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I am a newly hired nurse under probation and plan to resign immediately due to health issues. Is it acceptable not to return to work after submitting my resignation letter?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>During your probationary period, you are allowed to resign, but it is essential to review the employment contract you signed. Some contracts require a notice period, even during probation. If health issues are your reason for immediate resignation, you may submit a medical certificate or documentation to explain the urgency. Legally, there is no penalty for resigning during probation, but you must ensure proper documentation to avoid any disputes with your employer. Communicating your intent clearly and in writing will help protect you from any claims of abandonment of duty. It’s also best to consult with your human resources department to clarify the company’s policies on resignation during probation.</p>
