<p>In the Philippines, the adoption process is governed by Republic Act No. 8552, also known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998. Under this law, adopting a child requires the consent of both biological parents, unless certain exceptions apply. If a person wishes to adopt their spouse's child, the consent of the child's biological mother is generally required.</p><p>However, the law provides exceptions where the mother's consent may not be necessary. These exceptions include circumstances where the mother has abandoned the child, where the mother has been declared legally incompetent, or where the mother's parental authority has been judicially terminated. In such cases, the court may proceed with the adoption without the mother's consent, provided that it is in the best interest of the child.</p><p>It is important to note that adoption proceedings in the Philippines are strictly regulated and involve a thorough assessment by social workers and the courts to ensure the welfare of the child. The process includes home studies, background checks, and a court hearing where all interested parties, including the biological parents if available, are given an opportunity to express their views.</p><p>Any attempt to bypass the legal requirements for adoption, including obtaining consent, can result in the adoption being declared void and may expose the parties involved to legal penalties. It is therefore crucial to follow the proper legal procedures and obtain all necessary consents to ensure a valid and lawful adoption.</p>
