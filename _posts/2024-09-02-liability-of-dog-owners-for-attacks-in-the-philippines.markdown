<p>In the Philippines, dog owners are legally responsible for the actions of their pets, particularly if a dog causes harm to individuals or damages property. According to Republic Act No. 9482, also known as the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, dog owners are required to maintain control over their pets, ensuring they do not pose a threat to public safety. If a dog chases, bites, or otherwise injures a person, the owner may be held liable for both criminal and civil penalties.</p><p>Civil liability may include the payment of damages to the injured party, covering medical expenses, and compensation for any other losses suffered due to the incident. Criminal liability can arise if the owner is found negligent in controlling the dog, particularly if the dog has a history of aggression and the owner failed to take preventive measures. In cases of serious injury or death caused by the dog, the owner could face imprisonment and fines.</p><p>To mitigate liability, dog owners should ensure their pets are properly trained, kept on a leash when in public areas, and vaccinated against rabies. Moreover, it is advisable to take out liability insurance that covers potential damages caused by pets. Proactive measures not only protect the public but also safeguard the owner from legal repercussions.</p>
