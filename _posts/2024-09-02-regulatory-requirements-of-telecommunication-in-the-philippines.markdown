<p>In the Philippines, the telecommunications industry is regulated primarily by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), an attached agency under the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). The NTC is tasked with the supervision, adjudication, and control over all telecommunications services in the country. To operate legally, telecommunication companies must secure a legislative franchise from the Congress of the Philippines. This franchise allows them to establish and operate telecommunication systems within the country. Additionally, they must obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the NTC, which certifies that the company's operations are in the public's interest. Compliance with these regulatory requirements ensures that telecommunication services meet the necessary standards for quality, affordability, and accessibility, protecting the interests of consumers while promoting competition and innovation in the sector.</p>
