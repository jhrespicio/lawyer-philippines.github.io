<p>Filming someone without their consent and posting it on social media can lead to legal consequences under Philippine law. The Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9995) prohibits the recording, reproduction, and distribution of photos or videos of individuals taken without their consent when it may damage their dignity or violate their privacy. Violation of this law can result in fines and imprisonment. Additionally, such actions may give rise to civil liabilities for invasion of privacy or defamation, depending on the content and context of the video. Individuals who believe their rights have been violated should seek legal advice and may file a complaint with the proper authorities.</p>
