<p>In the Philippines, while there is no specific law that mandates the use of preferred names and pronouns, the general principles of respect and non-discrimination are upheld by various legal frameworks. The Anti-Bullying Act and the Safe Spaces Act, for instance, promote the protection of individuals from any form of bullying or harassment, which can include the intentional misuse of names and pronouns.</p><p>Misusing or refusing to use an individualâ€™s preferred name or pronouns can be seen as a form of harassment or discrimination, particularly if it is done repeatedly or with malice. Such actions could lead to disciplinary measures within the workplace, and in some cases, may result in legal actions under civil law for damages, especially if it can be proven that the individual suffered harm or distress due to the misuse.</p><p>Employers are encouraged to adopt inclusive policies that respect employees' gender identities and expressions, as part of their commitment to creating a safe and equitable workplace. This not only fosters a more inclusive environment but also aligns with the broader human rights principles enshrined in Philippine laws and international conventions to which the Philippines is a signatory.</p>
