<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>How can I file a complaint against an online casino?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>To file a complaint against an online casino in the Philippines, you need to determine whether the casino is operating legally. If the casino is licensed by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), you can file a complaint directly with them. Provide all relevant details and evidence related to your complaint. If the casino is unlicensed or operating illegally, you can report it to the authorities, such as the NBI or the Philippine National Police (PNP), for further investigation. Engaging with a lawyer who specializes in cybercrime or online gambling issues can also be beneficial.</p>
