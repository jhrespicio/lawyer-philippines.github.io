<p>In the Philippines, the sale of real estate properties is subject to a Capital Gains Tax (CGT), which is a tax on the profit earned from the sale of capital assets. According to the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines, specifically Section 24(D), the seller or transferor is generally responsible for the payment of the Capital Gains Tax. The CGT is equivalent to 6% of the gross selling price or fair market value of the property, whichever is higher.</p><p>It is common practice for the seller to bear the cost of the Capital Gains Tax as it is a tax on the profit they have made from the sale. However, in some cases, the buyer and seller may agree that the buyer will shoulder the CGT as part of the negotiation process. This arrangement is legal as long as both parties consent to it and it is clearly stipulated in the sale agreement or contract to sell.</p><p>It is important for both parties to understand the implications of such an agreement. If the buyer agrees to pay the CGT, this could effectively increase the total cost of purchasing the property. On the other hand, the seller may be able to negotiate a higher selling price to offset the tax liability they would have otherwise incurred.</p><p>Regardless of who pays the Capital Gains Tax, it is crucial that the payment is made to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) within 30 days from the date of sale. Failure to pay the CGT on time can result in penalties, interest, and surcharges. Additionally, the BIR will not issue a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) needed for the transfer of the property title to the buyer unless the CGT is fully paid.</p><p>Both the buyer and seller should seek legal and financial advice before agreeing to any terms related to the payment of Capital Gains Tax to ensure that their rights and obligations are clearly understood and properly documented.</p>
