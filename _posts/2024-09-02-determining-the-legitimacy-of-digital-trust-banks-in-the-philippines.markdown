<p>The rise of digital banking in the Philippines has brought convenience to many, but it has also raised concerns about the legitimacy of some digital trust banks. To ensure the safety of your funds, it is crucial to verify the legitimacy of a digital bank before engaging in any transactions. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is the central regulatory authority that licenses and oversees banks in the country, including digital banks.

It is also advisable to be cautious of any offers that seem too good to be true, as these may be indicative of fraudulent schemes.</p><p>By taking these precautionary steps, consumers can protect themselves from potential scams and ensure that their funds are managed by a trustworthy institution.</p>
