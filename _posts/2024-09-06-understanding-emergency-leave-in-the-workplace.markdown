<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to know the policies surrounding emergency leave at work. What are the requirements, and how can I avail of this leave?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Emergency leave is generally covered under the employer’s internal leave policies, though there are no specific provisions for it under Philippine labor laws. Employees may request emergency leave, but the approval is often subject to the company’s discretion or its employee handbook.</p><p>That said, in case of illness or immediate family emergencies, employees can apply for a leave using their available sick leaves or vacation leaves. In extreme cases, such as death in the immediate family, you may be eligible for bereavement leave under certain conditions. It is advisable to review your company’s internal policies or inquire with the HR department for clarification on your emergency leave entitlements.</p>
