<p>Starting a business in the Philippines requires compliance with various regulatory requirements, including securing a business permit from the local government unit (LGU) where the business is located. Failure to obtain the necessary permits before operating can result in penalties and fines from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Entrepreneurs who register their business with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) but fail to secure a business permit may be subject to penalties if they operate without proper authorization. Additionally, business owners must register with the BIR within 30 days from the start of operations to avoid penalties for late registration. It is advisable to seek guidance from legal professionals or consult with the BIR to rectify any lapses and ensure full compliance with tax and regulatory obligations.</p>
