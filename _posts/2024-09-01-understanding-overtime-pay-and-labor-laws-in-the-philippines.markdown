<p>Under Philippine labor law, employees who work beyond the regular 8-hour workday are entitled to overtime pay. The Labor Code of the Philippines specifies that overtime work should be compensated at a rate of at least 25% more than the regular hourly rate for ordinary days, and 30% more for rest days or holidays. However, the law does not mandate a 'double basic salary' for working 18 hours in one day.

It's important for both employers and employees to understand their rights and obligations under the Labor Code to ensure compliance with labor standards.</p>
