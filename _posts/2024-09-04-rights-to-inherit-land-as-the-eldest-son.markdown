<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My father passed away, and our family owns a piece of land. As the eldest male, do I automatically inherit the land?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In Philippine law, inheritance is governed by the Civil Code and the principle of legal succession. The law does not prioritize inheritance based on gender or birth order. Instead, the estate of a deceased person, including land, is equally divided among the legal heirs, which typically include the spouse and children. In the absence of a will, inheritance follows the rules of intestate succession. If you are the eldest son, you have no automatic right to inherit the land exclusively, but you are entitled to an equal share with your siblings and your father's surviving spouse. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to properly settle the estate and avoid any disputes among heirs.</p>
