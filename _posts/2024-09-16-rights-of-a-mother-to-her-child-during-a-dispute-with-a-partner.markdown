<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br/>My partner and I often argue, and during our disputes, he takes our child away from me and refuses to let me hold the baby. He also doesn't provide enough for the baby’s needs even though he works. What are my rights as a mother?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br/>As a mother, you have equal parental rights over your child, regardless of your relationship with the father. The Family Code of the Philippines gives both parents joint custody unless there is a court order to the contrary. If your partner is withholding your child from you during disputes, this may be grounds for legal action. You can file for custody if necessary, and the court will consider the best interests of the child. If your partner fails to adequately provide for your child’s needs, you can also seek legal support by filing for financial child support. The law ensures that both parents contribute fairly to the child’s upbringing and welfare, and failure to do so may result in legal consequences.</p>
