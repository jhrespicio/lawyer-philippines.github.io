<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p>
<p>I recently provided a service to an individual who has failed to pay the agreed amount despite repeated requests. I would like to know how to start a small claims case to ensure that I can recover the money owed to me. What are the steps involved in filing a case, and what should I do to make sure I get the payment?</p>
<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>
<p>A Concerned Service Provider</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the Philippines, filing a small claims case is a streamlined process designed to resolve disputes quickly and without the need for legal representation. The process is applicable for claims involving money owed from various transactions, such as unpaid loans, services rendered, or goods sold.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prepare Your Documents:</strong> Gather all necessary documents related to your claim. These may include contracts, receipts, invoices, promissory notes, text messages, or any form of communication that proves the transaction and the amount owed.</li>
<li><strong>Visit the Small Claims Court:</strong> Go to the Office of the Clerk of Court in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Municipal Trial Court (MTC), or Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) that has jurisdiction over the place where the defendant resides or where the transaction took place.</li>
<li><strong>File a Statement of Claim:</strong> Submit a verified Statement of Claim with all the supporting documents attached. The court will provide you with forms for this purpose. Ensure that you clearly state the details of your claim, including the amount owed and the circumstances leading to the non-payment.</li>
<li><strong>Pay the Filing Fees:</strong> After submitting your Statement of Claim, you will be required to pay the corresponding filing fees. The amount varies depending on the claim, but in some cases, indigent parties may be exempted from paying these fees.</li>
<li><strong>Serve the Summons:</strong> The court will issue a summons to the defendant, notifying them of the claim filed against them and the scheduled hearing date. The summons must be served personally to the defendant, and it is usually done by the sheriff or a court officer.</li>
<li><strong>Attend the Hearing:</strong> On the scheduled date, both parties are required to attend the hearing. The court will attempt to mediate and help the parties reach an amicable settlement. If no settlement is reached, the court will proceed with the hearing, allowing both parties to present their evidence and arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Receive the Decision:</strong> After the hearing, the judge will render a decision based on the merits of the case. If the decision is in your favor, the court will issue an order for the defendant to pay the amount owed.</li>
<li><strong>Enforce the Judgment:</strong> If the defendant fails to comply with the courtâ€™s decision, you may request the court to issue a writ of execution, which will allow you to enforce the judgment and recover the money through garnishment of wages, bank accounts, or other assets of the defendant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Filing a small claims case can be an effective way to recover money owed without the complexity of a full-blown lawsuit. By following the steps outlined above and ensuring that all your documentation is in order, you increase your chances of a favorable outcome.</p>
<p>Remember that while legal representation is not required in small claims cases, seeking advice from a lawyer can still be beneficial, especially if the case involves complicated issues.</p>
