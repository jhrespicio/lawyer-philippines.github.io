<p>Employees in the Philippines have the right to file a complaint against their employers for violations of labor laws, such as non-payment of the 13th-month pay, inadequate SSS contributions, and unpaid holiday or overtime work. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) provides a mechanism for workers to file such complaints. An employee can submit a complaint directly to the DOLE regional office, which will then mediate between the employee and employer to resolve the issue. If mediation fails, the case may proceed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for adjudication. Employees should provide documentation, such as pay slips and employment contracts, to support their claims.</p>
