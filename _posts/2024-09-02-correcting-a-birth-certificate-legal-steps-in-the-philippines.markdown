<p>In the Philippines, the process of correcting or changing information on a birth certificate is governed by Republic Act No. 9048, which allows for the administrative correction of clerical or typographical errors, and Republic Act No. 10172, which extends this to cover changes in first names and gender. However, changes to the father’s name, particularly in cases involving the recognition of a biological father, require a more formal legal process.</p><p>To change the registered father's name on a birth certificate to reflect the biological father's name, a petition for correction must be filed with the local civil registrar or the court. This typically involves submitting proof of the biological father's identity, such as DNA evidence or a sworn acknowledgment of paternity, along with other supporting documents.</p><p>The court will evaluate the evidence and, if satisfied, issue an order for the civil registrar to amend the birth certificate. This process is often lengthy and requires the assistance of legal counsel to ensure compliance with procedural requirements.</p><p>It is important to note that such changes are not taken lightly, as they involve the legal recognition of parental rights and responsibilities. The biological father's acknowledgment, as well as the implications for the child’s inheritance and legal status, must be carefully considered. Legal advice is essential to navigate this process effectively.</p>
