<p>Under Philippine tax laws, all individuals earning income within the Philippines are required to file an annual Income Tax Return (ITR). This includes those earning income from employment, business, or other sources, even if the income is derived from informal or non-traditional work arrangements, such as assisting in an online business. However, individuals whose annual income falls below a certain threshold may be exempt from filing, particularly if their income is solely from employment where the proper taxes have already been withheld and remitted by the employer. It is advisable to consult with a tax professional or the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to determine specific filing requirements based on individual circumstances.</p>
