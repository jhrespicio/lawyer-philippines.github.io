<p>In the Philippines, cyber libel is a serious offense under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). When a warrant of arrest is issued for cyber libel, the accused has the right to post bail, allowing them to remain free while the case is being heard. The amount of bail is determined by the court and is influenced by factors such as the nature of the offense and the accusedâ€™s criminal history.</p><p>If the accused wishes to surrender voluntarily, they can do so by appearing before the court that issued the warrant or by going to the nearest police station. Voluntary surrender is often viewed favorably by the court and can be considered a mitigating circumstance, potentially reducing the severity of any eventual penalties.</p><p>After surrendering, the accused can apply for bail, either immediately or after a bail hearing. It is advisable to seek legal counsel to navigate the complexities of the legal process and to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected throughout the proceedings.</p>
