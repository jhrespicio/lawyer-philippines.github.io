**Simplified Question: Is a Deed of Absolute Sale proof of ownership?**

A Deed of Absolute Sale is an important legal document in the Philippines, as it serves as evidence that a transaction occurred between a buyer and a seller for a specific property. However, it is essential to understand that this document alone does not constitute proof of ownership of the property.

The Deed of Absolute Sale is a record of the agreement where the seller transfers all rights, interests, and ownership of the property to the buyer. While it shows that a sale has been made, the actual transfer of ownership is only considered complete when the property title is registered under the name of the buyer with the Register of Deeds.

Ownership is legally recognized when the transfer of the title has been properly documented, which includes paying all necessary taxes, such as the Capital Gains Tax and Documentary Stamp Tax, and obtaining a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). After these steps, the buyer must file for the transfer of the title, ensuring that it reflects their name as the new owner.

It is crucial to ensure that the title is free from any liens or encumbrances, as these could affect the buyer's ownership rights. A clean title, free from legal claims or debts, is the ultimate proof of ownership.

In conclusion, while the Deed of Absolute Sale is a critical step in the process of acquiring property, it is not, by itself, sufficient proof of ownership. The title of the property, once transferred and registered in the buyer's name, serves as the true and legal proof of ownership.
