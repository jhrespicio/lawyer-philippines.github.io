<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I accidentally sent money to the wrong number. Is there any way I can recover the amount?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, recovering money sent to the wrong person may be possible under the principle of unjust enrichment as stated in Article 22 of the Civil Code. The recipient has no right to keep money that does not belong to them. You may try to contact the person and request the return of the funds, providing proof of the mistaken transaction. If the person refuses, you may file a complaint before the courts or a small claims case, depending on the amount involved. It's important to gather all evidence, such as transaction receipts and communication, to support your claim.</p>
