<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to know if I can obtain a police clearance. What are the requirements and conditions?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Yes, you can obtain a police clearance, provided that you meet certain requirements. Police clearance is usually issued by the Philippine National Police (PNP) in your local municipality or city. You will need to present valid identification, fill out the necessary forms, and pay a minimal fee. The clearance will reflect any criminal records associated with your name. If you have no pending criminal cases or derogatory records, you should be able to obtain one without any issues. Please ensure that you bring the required documents, such as valid IDs and your Community Tax Certificate (Cedula), when you apply for the clearance.</p>
