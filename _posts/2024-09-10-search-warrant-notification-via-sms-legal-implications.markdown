<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I received an SMS notification stating that I have a search warrant. Is this valid? What should I do in response to this message?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>A search warrant is a legal document that must be issued by a judge after due process, and it is typically served in person by law enforcement officers, not through SMS. Receiving such a notification via text message is highly unusual and could potentially be a scam. If you are concerned, it is advisable to consult a lawyer and verify the legitimacy of the message with local law enforcement. Additionally, you should avoid responding to suspicious messages and take precautions to protect your personal information.</p>
