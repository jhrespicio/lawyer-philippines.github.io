<p>Employees in the Philippines who experience delays in receiving their salary due to circumstances beyond their control, such as late payments from an overseas employer, may request an extension or deferment from their creditors. Under Philippine labor law, particularly the Labor Code, employees are entitled to timely payment of wages, and employers are obligated to pay salaries on time. However, if an employee's salary is delayed due to an international transaction, they may need to communicate with their creditors or financial institutions to request a temporary extension. While this is not a legal right, it is a reasonable request that can be negotiated, especially if supported by documentation from the employer.</p>
