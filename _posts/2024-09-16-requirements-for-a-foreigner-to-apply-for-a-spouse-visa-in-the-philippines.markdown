<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am a foreigner married to a Filipino citizen, and I am planning to apply for a spouse visa to live in the Philippines. Could you kindly advise me on what the specific requirements are to apply for a spouse visa and the process involved?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>To apply for a spouse visa in the Philippines, commonly referred to as the 13(a) Non-Quota Immigrant Visa, a foreigner married to a Filipino citizen must meet several requirements. The application must be filed at the Bureau of Immigration or at a Philippine consulate if the applicant is abroad. Key requirements include:</p><ul><li>Accomplished visa application form</li><li>Marriage certificate, duly authenticated or issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)</li><li>Birth certificate of Filipino spouse (PSA-authenticated)</li><li>Valid passport of the foreign spouse with a minimum of six months validity</li><li>Proof of financial capacity (e.g., bank certificates, proof of employment or business)</li><li>Clearance from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for the foreign spouse</li><li>Proof of residence in the Philippines (for local applications)</li></ul><p>The process involves filing the application, submitting documents, and undergoing an interview. It is recommended to consult the Bureau of Immigration for the latest requirements as they can change. After the visa is granted, it is valid for one year and can be renewed.</p>
