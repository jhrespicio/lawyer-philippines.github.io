<p>Attempted sexual assault is a serious offense under Philippine law, and victims have the right to seek legal redress even if the assault was not completed. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines provides for penalties for acts of lasciviousness, which can include attempts to engage in sexual activities without consent. Attempted rape or acts of lasciviousness can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment.</p><p>Victims of attempted sexual assault should report the incident to the authorities as soon as possible. Even in the absence of direct physical evidence, such as witnesses or recordings, other forms of evidence can still be presented. This can include testimonies, medical records (if any injuries were sustained), and any circumstantial evidence that supports the victim's account.</p><p>It's also important for victims to seek support from organizations and legal experts who can guide them through the process of filing a complaint and seeking justice. The lack of immediate evidence does not invalidate the victim's experience, and law enforcement officers are trained to handle such cases with sensitivity and thoroughness. Prompt reporting and consultation with legal professionals can significantly enhance the chances of successful prosecution.</p>
