<p>In the Philippines, the process of changing a child's surname is governed by the provisions of the Family Code and the Civil Registry Law. A child born out of wedlock is typically registered under the surname of the mother, especially if the father has not recognized the child. However, there are instances where a mother or a father may wish to change the child’s surname to reflect either parent's surname.</p><p>For children born out of wedlock, the recognition or acknowledgment by the father can be done through the execution of an affidavit of acknowledgment or by indicating the father's name in the birth certificate upon registration. Once the father’s acknowledgment is properly documented, the child's surname may be changed to that of the father, provided the child is still a minor and such change is done in the child’s best interest.</p><p>If the parent desires to change the surname to that of the mother after the child has been registered under the father’s surname, a judicial process may be required. The petition to change the surname must be filed with the Regional Trial Court. The court will consider the best interest of the child and the reasons for the request before issuing a decision.</p><p>Furthermore, any changes in the birth certificate must be annotated in the civil registry where the birth was originally registered. It is essential to consult with a family law attorney to ensure that all legal requirements are met and that the process is handled properly to avoid complications.</p>
