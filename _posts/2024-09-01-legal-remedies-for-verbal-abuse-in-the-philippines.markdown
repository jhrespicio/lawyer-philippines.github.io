<p>In the Philippines, individuals who are subjected to verbal abuse or defamatory statements have legal remedies under the Revised Penal Code and other relevant laws. Verbal abuse may fall under various criminal offenses such as slander (oral defamation), unjust vexation, or even grave threats, depending on the severity and nature of the statements made.</p><p>Slander, as defined under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code, involves speaking ill of another person, which may harm their reputation or dignity. If the abusive words are public and intended to insult or cause damage, the person responsible can be held criminally liable. Victims of slander can file a criminal complaint with the appropriate authorities, typically starting with a barangay conciliation process unless exempted by law.</p><p>Aside from criminal remedies, the victim may also pursue a civil case for damages under Article 26 of the Civil Code, which provides that any act that violates the rights of another may result in liability. This means that victims of verbal abuse can seek compensation for any psychological harm, humiliation, or damage to their reputation resulting from the abusive words.</p><p>It is crucial for victims of verbal abuse to document the incidents carefully, gather evidence, and seek legal advice to determine the most appropriate course of action.</p>
