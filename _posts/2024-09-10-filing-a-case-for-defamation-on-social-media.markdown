<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Someone has been posting false accusations about me on social media and even tagging me in the posts. My name is specifically mentioned in the accusations. What case can I file in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, you may file a case for libel, which is a form of defamation that occurs through publication, including on social media. Libel is defined under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code as a public and malicious imputation of a crime, vice, or defect that tends to cause dishonor or discredit. If the posts damage your reputation and are done with malice, you can file a complaint for cyber libel under Republic Act No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. It's important to gather all evidence, such as screenshots and links to the posts, to support your case.</p>
