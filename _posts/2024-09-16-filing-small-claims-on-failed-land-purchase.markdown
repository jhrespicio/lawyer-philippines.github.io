<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> We were in the process of buying a piece of land, but the transaction fell through. Can we file a small claims case for this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Yes, you can file a small claims case if there was a contract or agreement related to the purchase of the land and the seller failed to honor it. Small claims court is designed to handle disputes involving monetary claims and can be used if you seek compensation for money paid, expenses, or damages resulting from the failed transaction. Ensure you have documentation, such as receipts, agreements, and communications, to support your claim when you file with the appropriate small claims court.</p>
