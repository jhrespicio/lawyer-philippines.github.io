<p>In the Philippines, being falsely accused by a seller can be a distressing experience, but there are legal remedies available. If a seller files a case against you without valid grounds, this could be considered a malicious prosecution or a case of false accusation. Under Philippine law, if you are wrongfully sued, you can file a counterclaim for damages against the seller. The court may award damages if it is proven that the seller acted in bad faith, with malice, or without probable cause.</p><p>If you are summoned to court, it is crucial to respond appropriately and present any evidence that can prove your innocence. This may include receipts, contracts, or communications that disprove the seller's claims. Consulting with a lawyer is highly recommended to navigate the legal process and ensure your rights are protected. The burden of proof generally lies with the accuser, so if they cannot substantiate their claims, the case may be dismissed.</p>
