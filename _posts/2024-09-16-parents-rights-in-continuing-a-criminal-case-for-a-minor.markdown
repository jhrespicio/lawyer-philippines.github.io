<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My 16-year-old sibling no longer wants to continue the case against the suspect. Do our parents still have the right to pursue the case even if the victim does not want to? What are their legal rights in this situation?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In criminal cases where the victim is a minor, parents or legal guardians generally have the authority to act on behalf of the child, especially if the case involves serious criminal offenses. Even if the child wishes to withdraw from the case, the parents can decide to continue pursuing it for the protection of their child and to ensure justice is served. However, in cases like this, the prosecutor may also determine whether there is sufficient evidence to continue the case independently of the victim’s wishes. The State’s interest in ensuring justice for criminal acts may outweigh the individual preferences of the victim, particularly in cases involving minors or serious offenses.</p>
