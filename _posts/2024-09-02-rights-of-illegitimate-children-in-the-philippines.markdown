<p>Illegitimate children in the Philippines are those born to parents who are not legally married to each other. Despite the absence of marriage between their parents, illegitimate children have rights under Philippine law, particularly under the Family Code and related statutes.</p><p>One of the key rights of an illegitimate child is the right to support from both parents. This support includes provisions for basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care. The amount of support is typically determined based on the financial capacity of the parent and the needs of the child.</p><p>Illegitimate children also have inheritance rights, although these are more limited compared to legitimate children. Under the law, an illegitimate child is entitled to half of the inheritance that a legitimate child would receive from the estate of their parents. If the parents do not have a will, the illegitimate child can still claim their share as provided by law.</p><p>Issues may arise when the legal wife or other legitimate heirs refuse to acknowledge the rights of an illegitimate child. In such cases, the child or their legal guardian can file a petition in court to enforce their rights. The court can order the rightful share of inheritance and support, ensuring that the illegitimate child is not deprived of their legal entitlements.</p><p>Legal battles over these rights can be complex, so it is crucial to seek legal advice to navigate the process and ensure that the childâ€™s rights are protected.</p>
