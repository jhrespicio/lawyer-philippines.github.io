<p>Estafa, or swindling, is a criminal offense in the Philippines, defined under the Revised Penal Code. It involves defrauding another person by abuse of confidence, deceit, or fraudulent means. Common forms of estafa include misappropriation of funds, fraudulent schemes, and making false pretenses to obtain something of value. In cases involving relationships, such as where one party allegedly misrepresents facts to the other, estafa charges may be brought if it can be proven that there was an intent to deceive and that the aggrieved party suffered damage as a result.</p><p>Defending against an estafa charge requires demonstrating that there was no intent to defraud, that the accused acted in good faith, or that the elements of the crime are not present. It is crucial to gather all relevant evidence, such as communications, transactions, and witness testimonies, to support the defense. Estafa cases can be complex, and the outcomes often hinge on the specifics of the case and the quality of the legal representation. Given the serious consequences of a conviction, which can include imprisonment, it is advisable to seek expert legal counsel if accused of estafa.</p>
