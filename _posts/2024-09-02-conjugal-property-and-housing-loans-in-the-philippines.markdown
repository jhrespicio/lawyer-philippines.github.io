<p>In the Philippines, the concept of conjugal property is central to the property relations of married couples. Under the Family Code, all properties acquired during the marriage are generally considered conjugal, meaning they are owned equally by both spouses. However, there are exceptions to this rule, especially if a property is acquired before the marriage or is explicitly stated as exclusive property through a marriage settlement or prenuptial agreement. When a property is purchased through a Pag-IBIG housing loan before marriage, it is typically considered the exclusive property of the purchasing spouse. If the property is fully paid during the marriage without any prenuptial agreement or settlement, it may then be considered conjugal property. However, if the loan is paid using conjugal funds after marriage, the property may become part of the conjugal estate, subject to legal interpretations and agreements between the spouses.</p>
