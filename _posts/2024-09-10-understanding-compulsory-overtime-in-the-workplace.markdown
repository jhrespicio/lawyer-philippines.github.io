<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Our manager frequently asks us to work overtime during group projects. Iâ€™m unsure if this overtime is mandatory, and I want to know if I can refuse to participate without facing penalties. Is this considered compulsory overtime?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor laws, employees cannot be compelled to work overtime unless it is a matter of public interest or an emergency. In most cases, overtime work should be voluntary, and employees have the right to refuse. However, if you have previously agreed to certain overtime conditions in your contract or collective bargaining agreement, this may affect your decision. If overtime is requested, it must be compensated at the prescribed overtime rates. If you believe your manager is pressuring you into working overtime unfairly, you may raise the issue with HR or a labor authority.</p>
