<p>In the Philippines, employees are protected by various labor laws that ensure their rights are upheld in the workplace. One significant issue that some employees face is being forced to resign by their employer. Forced resignation is considered illegal and is viewed as a form of constructive dismissal under Philippine labor law.</p><p>Constructive dismissal occurs when an employee is compelled to resign due to unfair treatment, harassment, or unbearable working conditions. This is in violation of the employee's right to security of tenure. If an employee is forced to resign, they have the right to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).</p><p>To support a claim of constructive dismissal, the employee must provide evidence that the resignation was not voluntary and was due to the employer's actions. This could include documentation of any coercion, unfair treatment, or changes in work conditions that made it impossible for the employee to continue working.</p><p>If the NLRC or DOLE finds that constructive dismissal occurred, the employee may be entitled to reinstatement to their former position, back wages, and other forms of compensation. Employers found guilty of constructive dismissal may also face legal penalties.</p><p>It is crucial for employees to know their rights and to seek legal counsel if they believe they are being forced to resign against their will.</p>
