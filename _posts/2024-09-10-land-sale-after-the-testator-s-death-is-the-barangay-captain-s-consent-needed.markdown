<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>A client left a last will and testament declaring that all her land titles should be transferred to her daughter. After the client passed away, the daughter wants to sell the land, but the barangay captain of the barangay where the land is located is against the sale. Is it legal for the barangay captain to interfere in this matter?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, a barangay captain does not have the authority to prevent a rightful heir from selling inherited property, as long as the property has been validly transferred to the heir. The last will and testament should be probated, and once the legal process of transferring the land titles to the daughter is completed, she becomes the legal owner of the property and can dispose of it as she sees fit. The barangay captain’s approval is not a legal requirement for the sale of private property. However, all other legal requirements, such as the payment of taxes and the proper execution of a deed of sale, must be followed.</p>
