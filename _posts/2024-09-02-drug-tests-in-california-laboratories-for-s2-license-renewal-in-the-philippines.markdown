<p>In the Philippines, the renewal of an S2 license, which permits medical practitioners to prescribe dangerous drugs, requires compliance with specific regulations set by the Philippine Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB). One of the key requirements is a valid drug test conducted by a laboratory accredited by the DDB. While some professionals may consider getting tested abroad, such as in California, it is crucial to understand that the DDB only recognizes drug tests performed by laboratories within the Philippines that are duly accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) and other relevant regulatory bodies.
