<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to know if a case involving a cat bite can reach a judge, especially if the complainant has no evidence. What should I expect in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><p>A case involving a cat bite can potentially reach the courts if the complainant files a formal complaint. In cases like this, the burden of proof is on the complainant to provide evidence, such as medical records, photos, and witness statements, that demonstrate the injury and the circumstances surrounding the bite.</p><p>If there is no substantial evidence, the case may be dismissed early on. However, you should still take the complaint seriously and respond accordingly, especially if the case proceeds to the barangay level for mediation or to the court for a formal hearing. It is advisable to have legal representation to ensure your rights are protected and to prepare an appropriate defense, particularly if the case escalates to litigation.</p>
