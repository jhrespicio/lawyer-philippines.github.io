<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> Someone has filed a demand against me to fully pay an outstanding amount. What should I do to respond properly, and are there legal defenses I can raise to challenge this demand?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> When faced with a demand for payment, the first step is to review the claim carefully. Ensure that the demand is valid and reflects any agreements or contracts you entered into. If the demand is accurate, it's advisable to negotiate a payment plan or settle the debt as soon as possible to avoid escalation. However, if you dispute the amount or the basis for the claim, you may raise legal defenses such as lack of consideration, fraud, or that the demand exceeds what was agreed upon. A formal response should be prepared, and seeking legal counsel is critical to ensuring your rights are protected. If a case is filed, you may also defend yourself in small claims court, where legal representation is not mandatory but recommended.</p>
