<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My spouse is currently incarcerated for a drug-related case. He wants to apply for a plea bargain and subsequently apply for probation. Is this possible under Philippine law?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (RA 9165), plea bargaining is allowed in drug-related cases under certain conditions. Plea bargaining permits the accused to plead guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for a lighter sentence. However, not all cases qualify for probation. Probation is available only if the sentence is for imprisonment of less than six years, and it cannot be granted to those convicted of crimes that involve public order or moral turpitude. Depending on the specific circumstances of the case and the courtâ€™s discretion, your spouse may be able to apply for both plea bargaining and probation, subject to the approval of the court.</p>
