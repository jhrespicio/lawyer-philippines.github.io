<p>In the Philippines, the jurisdiction of barangay officials in resolving disputes is typically limited to their respective barangays. According to the Local Government Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7160), barangay officials are empowered to handle disputes through the Katarungang Pambarangay system, a mechanism for amicably settling conflicts at the community level. However, their jurisdiction is generally confined to cases involving parties residing within the same barangay. If a person resides in a different locality, such as a different city or municipality, the barangay officials of the complainantâ€™s barangay may not have the authority to summon the individual directly. Instead, the complaint may need to be referred to the barangay where the respondent resides. This ensures that the respondent is properly notified and that the case is heard in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some cases, the complaint may need to be elevated to a higher legal authority if the parties are from different localities.</p>
