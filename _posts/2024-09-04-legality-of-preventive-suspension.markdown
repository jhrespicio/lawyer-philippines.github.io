<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was placed under preventive suspension for one month after a complaint was filed against me. Is this legal, and for how long can a preventive suspension last?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Preventive suspension is allowed under Philippine law when an employee is being investigated for a serious offense, and the employer believes that the employeeâ€™s continued presence in the workplace may pose a threat to the company or other employees. However, the Labor Code limits the duration of preventive suspension to 30 days. If the suspension exceeds this period, the employee should either be reinstated or the employer should proceed with disciplinary actions, including termination, if warranted by the findings of the investigation. You may contest the legality of an extended suspension with the DOLE or through legal counsel if your suspension exceeds the prescribed limit without proper cause.</p>
