<p>In the Philippines, the death of the principal borrower does not automatically extinguish the obligation to continue housing loan payments. If the housing loan was secured through the National Housing Authority (NHA) or any other financial institution, the responsibility to continue payments typically passes to the heirs or co-borrowers. The terms of the loan agreement may specify how this transition occurs and whether the loan is covered by mortgage redemption insurance (MRI).</p><p>If the loan is covered by MRI, the insurance may pay off the remaining balance of the loan upon the death of the principal borrower, thus relieving the heirs of the obligation. However, if there is no such insurance, the heirs or co-borrowers must continue the payments to avoid foreclosure. It is advisable for the heirs to inform the lending institution of the principal borrower's death promptly and to review the terms of the loan agreement to understand their responsibilities.</p>
