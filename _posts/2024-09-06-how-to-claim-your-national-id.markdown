<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to know how I can claim my National ID. What steps should I follow?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) requires individuals to undergo registration and verification before claiming their National ID. Once registered, PhilSys will issue a unique PhilID number. After completing the registration process, including the biometric data capture, individuals will receive a notification from PhilSys when the ID is ready for delivery. The ID is usually delivered by the Philippine Postal Corporation to your registered address. If you have not received your ID within the specified time frame, you may contact the PhilSys hotline or check your registration status online through their official website.</p>
