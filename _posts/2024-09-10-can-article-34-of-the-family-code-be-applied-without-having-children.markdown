<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am planning to get married soon and would like to know if it's necessary to have children for us to apply Article 34 of the Family Code, which allows for marriage without the need for a marriage license. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Article 34 of the Family Code of the Philippines, no marriage license is required if the man and woman have lived together as husband and wife for at least five years and have no legal impediment to marry. There is no requirement to have children to benefit from this provision. The primary conditions are cohabitation for at least five years and the absence of any other legal impediments. This provision is intended to simplify the process for couples who have already established a long-term, committed relationship.</p>
