<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>A person used funds from several individuals for personal expenses, claiming it was for an album, but it turns out it was a scam. What legal action can we take against this person?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>This appears to be a case of estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, which penalizes swindling or deceitful schemes. If the person received money for an album and diverted it for personal use without fulfilling their obligation, they could be charged with estafa, which involves fraud and breach of trust. Filing a criminal complaint for estafa may allow the victims to seek both criminal penalties and civil damages for the financial losses incurred.</p>
