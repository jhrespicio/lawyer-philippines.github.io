<p>A Special Power of Attorney (SPA) is a legal document that authorizes another person to act on behalf of the principal in specific matters. In the Philippines, an SPA is often used for various transactions, such as selling property, managing business affairs, or handling legal matters when the principal is unable to do so personally. The SPA must clearly specify the powers granted to the agent and the scope of their authority.</p><p>While it is possible for an individual to draft their own SPA, it is highly recommended to have the document reviewed and notarized by a lawyer to ensure its legality and enforceability. The SPA must be clear and precise, detailing the specific acts the agent is authorized to perform. It should also include the full names of both the principal and the agent, as well as any relevant identification details.</p><p>After drafting the SPA, the principal must sign it in the presence of a notary public. The notary will verify the identities of the parties involved, ensure that the document was signed voluntarily, and affix their notarial seal. Once notarized, the SPA becomes a public document and can be used in legal and financial transactions.</p><p>In some cases, an SPA may need to be authenticated by the Philippine Embassy or Consulate if the principal is abroad. This is particularly important for transactions involving property or other significant assets in the Philippines. The authentication process may involve additional steps, such as providing proof of identity and residency.</p><p>It is important to note that an SPA can be revoked or terminated by the principal at any time, provided that the revocation is communicated to the agent and any third parties involved in the transaction. The revocation should also be notarized to ensure its validity.</p><p>Given the potential for abuse, it is crucial to choose an agent who is trustworthy and capable of handling the responsibilities assigned to them. The agent is legally obligated to act in the best interests of the principal and to carry out their duties with due diligence and care.</p>
