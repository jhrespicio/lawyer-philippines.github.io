<p>In the Philippines, when an employee resigns, they are entitled to receive their final pay, which includes their last salary, any unpaid benefits, and other monetary entitlements. Employers are not allowed to withhold this final pay without a valid reason. If the employer decides to withhold the final pay due to alleged liabilities or other reasons, they must inform the employee in writing and provide justification. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) provides guidelines on the timely release of final pay, and employees who experience delays or withholding of their final pay without proper cause can file a complaint with DOLE to seek redress.</p>
