<p>In the Philippines, parents are legally obligated to provide financial support for their children, regardless of whether the parents are married or not. This support is referred to as child support and is essential for the child's upbringing, including expenses for education, healthcare, and daily needs. When a parent fails to provide sufficient support, the custodial parent or guardian may seek legal remedies to enforce the obligation. This can involve filing a petition in court to compel the other parent to provide the necessary financial support. The court will assess the parent's ability to pay and the child's needs to determine a fair amount of support. In cases where the parent still fails to comply with the court order, legal actions such as contempt of court or garnishment of wages may be pursued to ensure compliance. It is important for parents to understand that child support is a legal duty, and failure to provide adequate support can result in legal consequences.</p>
