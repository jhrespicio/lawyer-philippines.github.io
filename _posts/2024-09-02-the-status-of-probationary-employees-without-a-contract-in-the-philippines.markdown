<p>In the Philippines, the employment status of probationary employees is governed by labor laws, which provide protections even when a written employment contract does not exist. The absence of a written contract does not automatically mean that an employee is without rights or status.</p><ul><li><strong>Implied Employment Relationship:</strong> Even without a contract, an employment relationship can be implied by the fact that the employee is working and receiving compensation. The employer is still bound by labor laws to provide the necessary benefits and protections to the employee.</li><li><strong>Probationary Period:</strong> Under Philippine law, a probationary period should not exceed six months. If an employee continues to work beyond this period without a written contract, they may be considered a regular employee, entitled to all benefits and protections.</li><li><strong>Security of Tenure:</strong> Probationary employees have the right to security of tenure. They cannot be terminated without just or authorized cause, even during the probationary period. If no valid reason for termination exists, the employee may be deemed a regular employee.</li><li><strong>Right to Due Process:</strong> Employers are required to follow due process in terminating a probationary employee. This includes providing notice and a chance for the employee to defend themselves against the grounds for termination.</li><li><strong>Benefits Entitlement:</strong> Probationary employees are entitled to statutory benefits such as the 13th-month pay, Social Security System (SSS) contributions, and other benefits mandated by law.</li></ul><p>Employees who find themselves without a contract should still assert their rights under Philippine labor laws. It is advisable to seek legal counsel to navigate any disputes or issues that arise.</p>
