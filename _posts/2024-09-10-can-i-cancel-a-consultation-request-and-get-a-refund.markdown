<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Can I cancel a consultation request and request a refund if Iâ€™m unsure of the time and day I can attend?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Yes, in most cases, you can cancel a consultation request and request a refund, provided that the terms and conditions of the service provider or professional allow for such cancellations and refunds. You should review the agreement or terms of service you agreed to when you made the request to see if there are specific clauses about cancellations and refunds. Some professionals may allow full or partial refunds depending on when the cancellation is made, while others may impose fees for late cancellations. It is best to contact the service provider directly to clarify their cancellation policy and how you can proceed with the refund.</p>
