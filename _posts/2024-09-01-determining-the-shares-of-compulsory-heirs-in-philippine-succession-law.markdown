<p>The distribution of an estate under Philippine law is governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines, particularly the provisions on succession. Succession refers to the legal process by which the rights, obligations, and properties of a deceased person are transferred to their heirs.</p><p>In the context of succession, compulsory heirs are individuals who are entitled by law to receive a portion of the estate, regardless of the contents of the deceased&#39;s will. Compulsory heirs include legitimate children and descendants, legitimate parents and ascendants, and the surviving spouse. In the absence of these primary compulsory heirs, the illegitimate children and other relatives may be entitled to a portion of the estate.</p><p>The estate is divided according to specific rules depending on the presence and number of compulsory heirs. For instance, if the deceased is survived by legitimate children and a spouse, the estate is typically divided with one-half going to the legitimate children, divided equally among them, and one-fourth to the spouse, with the remaining one-fourth forming the free portion which the decedent may dispose of freely in a will.</p><p>In cases where only the spouse and no legitimate children survive, the spouse is entitled to one-half of the estate, with the remaining half being the free portion. The law provides detailed rules for various family configurations, ensuring that the legitime of each compulsory heir is protected.</p><p>Assets that are considered part of the estate include all properties owned by the deceased at the time of death, including real estate, personal property, bank accounts, and other financial assets. Certain deductions, such as debts and funeral expenses, are first made before the estate is distributed to the heirs.</p><p>Understanding the rights of compulsory heirs and the rules of succession is crucial for ensuring that the estate is distributed fairly and in accordance with Philippine law.</p>
