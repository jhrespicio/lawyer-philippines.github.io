<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I do not know my Tax Identification Number (TIN). What should I do to retrieve it? Is there any legal concern if I don't have this information?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Your TIN is a vital identifier for tax purposes, and all taxpayers in the Philippines are required to have one. If you’ve forgotten or misplaced your TIN, you can recover it by contacting the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). You can visit the nearest BIR office or use the BIR's eServices to retrieve your TIN. Not having or using multiple TINs can lead to penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code, so it’s important to ensure you are in compliance with tax regulations.</p>
