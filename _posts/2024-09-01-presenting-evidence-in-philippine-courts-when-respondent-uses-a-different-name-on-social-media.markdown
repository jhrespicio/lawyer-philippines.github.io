<p>In legal cases in the Philippines, the correct identification of the parties involved is crucial. If a respondent uses a different name or a name that is spelled backwards on social media platforms like Facebook, this can complicate the presentation of evidence. To address this, the complainant must establish that the social media profile indeed belongs to the respondent.

The complaint should then allege that the profile is used by the respondent, providing the court with a detailed explanation of the evidence that supports this claim.</p>
