<p>In recent years, the rise of online lending platforms in the Philippines has led to a corresponding increase in complaints from borrowers who experience harassment from lenders. This harassment often takes the form of threatening calls, texts, or messages, particularly when borrowers are unable to meet payment deadlines. Fortunately, there are legal measures that borrowers can take to protect themselves from such practices.</p><p>The first step is to be aware of the provisions of Republic Act No. 3765, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose all relevant loan terms, including interest rates, penalties, and fees. Borrowers who feel that they have been misled or harassed can file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulate lending companies in the country.</p><p>In cases where harassment involves threats, defamatory statements, or invasion of privacy, borrowers may also file a complaint for violation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9262) if the harassment targets women.</p><p>Additionally, the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) provides protection against unauthorized use or sharing of personal data by lending companies. Borrowers can file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) if their personal information has been misused or if they have been subjected to harassment due to the mishandling of their data.</p><p>It is important for borrowers facing harassment from online lenders to document all instances of harassment and seek legal assistance to determine the best course of action. Legal avenues are available to ensure that borrowers are protected from abusive practices and that lending companies adhere to fair and legal methods of debt collection.</p>
