<p>In the Philippines, the collection of debts must be conducted within the bounds of the law. The Fair Debt Collection Practices are governed by various regulations that protect debtors from harassment and other abusive practices by creditors or collection agencies. Harassment, in this context, includes threats of violence, public shaming, and other forms of intimidation to force repayment.</p><p>Under Philippine law, creditors are prohibited from using threats, intimidation, or any form of coercion to collect debts. If a creditor or collection agent engages in harassment, the debtor has the right to file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) if the harassment involves a violation of the Data Privacy Act, such as unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Additionally, the debtor can file a case with the appropriate court for damages arising from the abusive collection practices.</p><p>It is also advisable for debtors to document any instances of harassment, including recordings of phone calls, screenshots of messages, and any written communication from the creditor. This evidence can be crucial in pursuing legal action against the offending party. Consulting with a lawyer can help clarify the legal options available and ensure that the debtor's rights are upheld throughout the process.</p>
