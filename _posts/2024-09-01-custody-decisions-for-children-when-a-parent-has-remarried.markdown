<p>In the Philippines, the welfare and best interests of the child are the primary considerations in custody decisions. When a parent has remarried, it does not automatically disqualify them from retaining custody of their children. However, the court may take into account the new family dynamics, the living conditions, and the ability of the parent to provide for the child's needs. If the other parent, such as the father in this case, continues to provide financial support and has a stable profession, like being a seaman, the court may consider these factors in its decision. Ultimately, the decision on custody will be based on what arrangement would best serve the children's physical, emotional, and psychological needs.</p>
