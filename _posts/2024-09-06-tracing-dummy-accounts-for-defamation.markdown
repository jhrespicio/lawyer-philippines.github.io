<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am being defamed by someone using two dummy accounts on social media. They are spreading false information about me and involving other people. Is there a way to trace these accounts and hold the individuals responsible for cyber libel?<br><strong>Victim of Defamation</strong></p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175), you can file a case for cyber libel if someone is using social media to spread false and malicious information about you. Law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division have the capability to trace dummy accounts through proper legal channels, including obtaining subpoenas for social media platforms to release the necessary information. However, this process requires the filing of a formal complaint and the assistance of legal counsel to ensure your rights are protected and the proper procedures are followed.</p>
