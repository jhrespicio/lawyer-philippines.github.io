<p>Offloading is a common issue faced by Filipino travelers, particularly those who are suspected of engaging in human trafficking or illegal employment abroad. The Bureau of Immigration (BI) has the authority to offload passengers who are deemed to have insufficient documentation or questionable travel purposes. To avoid offloading, travelers should ensure they have all necessary documents, such as valid visas, proof of financial capability, and a clear itinerary. In cases where a traveler is unjustly offloaded, they may seek legal recourse by filing a complaint with the BI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), or through the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). Legal advice should be sought to understand the options available for challenging the offloading decision and to ensure compliance with immigration requirements in future travel.</p>
