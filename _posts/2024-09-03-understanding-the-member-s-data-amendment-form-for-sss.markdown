<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I need to change the receipt or beneficiary of my deceased parent’s Social Security System (SSS) account to myself, their daughter. I’ve heard of something called a ‘member’s data amendment form.’ What exactly is this, and is it a legal document?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>The Member’s Data Amendment Form is a document provided by the Social Security System (SSS) in the Philippines, used by members to update or correct their personal information or beneficiaries on record. This form is indeed a legal document, as it formalizes the process of changing important data in the SSS records. For your concern, you will need to fill out this form to change the designated beneficiary from your deceased parent to yourself. It is advisable to ensure that all supporting documents, such as proof of relationship and death certificates, are submitted alongside the amendment form to facilitate the process. Legal assistance may be required if there are any disputes or if the process becomes complicated.</p>
