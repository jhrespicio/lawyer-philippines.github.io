<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>The embassy requested an authorization letter from the father and his valid ID for my child to travel. What kind of document should I provide?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In cases where a child is traveling abroad with only one parent, the embassy typically requires a notarized authorization letter from the other parent (in this case, the father), stating that he consents to the child’s travel. This document should be signed and notarized. In addition, a copy of the father’s valid ID, such as a passport or government-issued ID, should be attached to confirm his identity. Be sure to check specific embassy requirements as they may vary slightly depending on the country.</p>
