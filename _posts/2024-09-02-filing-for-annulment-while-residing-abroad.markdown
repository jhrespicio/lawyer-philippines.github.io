<p>In the Philippines, the process of filing for annulment of marriage is a legal proceeding that can be initiated even if one of the spouses is residing abroad. However, the physical presence of the petitioner may be required at certain stages of the annulment process, particularly during court hearings.</p><p>To file for annulment, the petitioner must prepare a petition stating the grounds for annulment, which must be one of the legally recognized grounds under Philippine law, such as psychological incapacity, lack of consent, or fraud. The petition is then filed with the appropriate Family Court in the Philippines.</p><p>Once the petition is filed, the court will schedule hearings where the petitioner must present evidence to support the claim. If the petitioner is unable to attend the hearings in person due to residing abroad, they may request the court to allow them to testify via video conference or submit affidavits instead. However, this is subject to the discretion of the court and may not always be granted.</p><p>Additionally, the petitioner may appoint a representative or attorney-in-fact in the Philippines through a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) to handle certain procedural matters on their behalf. This can include filing the petition, attending preliminary hearings, and receiving court orders.</p><p>Given the complexities of the annulment process and the potential need for personal appearances, it is highly recommended to consult with a family law attorney in the Philippines who can provide guidance on the best course of action and represent the petitionerâ€™s interests throughout the proceedings.</p>
