<p>In the Philippines, the rights of employees regarding termination due to health conditions, including anxiety disorders, are protected under various labor laws. The Labor Code of the Philippines and the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons (Republic Act No. 7277) provide a framework to ensure that employees are not unjustly terminated due to health conditions that do not render them unfit for work.</p><p>An anxiety disorder, as a mental health condition, falls under the category of a disability if it substantially limits one or more major life activities. Employees diagnosed with an anxiety disorder are entitled to protection from discrimination and unjust termination. The law mandates that employers must provide reasonable accommodation to employees with disabilities, which could include adjustments to work schedules, responsibilities, or work environment to help them manage their condition while performing their job effectively.</p><p>An employee cannot be terminated solely on the basis of having an anxiety disorder unless it is proven that the condition renders the employee incapable of performing the essential duties of their position, even with reasonable accommodation. If the employer seeks to terminate an employee on such grounds, they must first conduct a thorough evaluation to determine whether the employeeâ€™s condition significantly impairs their ability to perform their job.</p><p>Furthermore, the termination process must follow due process as outlined in the Labor Code. This includes providing the employee with a notice specifying the grounds for termination, giving the employee an opportunity to be heard, and allowing the employee to respond to the charges against them. Failure to observe due process may render the termination illegal, entitling the employee to reinstatement or separation pay, along with possible damages.</p><p>Employees who believe they have been unfairly terminated due to an anxiety disorder can file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) or the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for redress. It is advisable for employees in such situations to seek legal counsel to ensure their rights are fully protected.</p>
