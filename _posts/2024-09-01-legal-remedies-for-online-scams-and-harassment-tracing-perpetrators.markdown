<p>Online scams and harassment are increasing concerns in the digital age, and the Philippines has laws in place to protect victims and prosecute offenders. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) provides a legal framework for addressing cybercrimes, including online scams and harassment. Victims can report incidents to the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) or the National Bureau of Investigation Cybercrime Division (NBI-CCD) for investigation. Through these agencies, it is possible to trace the location of the perpetrator using digital forensics and other investigative techniques. Additionally, victims may file criminal charges against the offender under the Revised Penal Code or the Cybercrime Prevention Act, depending on the nature of the offense.</p>
