<p>Debt collection in the Philippines is governed by various laws designed to ensure fairness and protect the rights of both creditors and debtors. When a debtor refuses to pay a debt despite the existence of a written agreement, the creditor has the right to pursue legal remedies to recover the amount owed.</p><p>The most common legal remedy is to file a collection case in court. If the debt amount is within the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court, the creditor can file a small claims case, which is a faster and more cost-effective method. In cases involving larger amounts, a regular civil action may be necessary. The court process may include the issuance of a demand letter, followed by the filing of a formal complaint if the debtor still fails to pay.</p><p>It is important to note that creditors cannot take matters into their own hands by using force or harassment to collect debts. Such actions can lead to criminal charges. Instead, creditors should seek the assistance of a lawyer to navigate the legal process and ensure that their rights are protected while also respecting the rights of the debtor.</p>
