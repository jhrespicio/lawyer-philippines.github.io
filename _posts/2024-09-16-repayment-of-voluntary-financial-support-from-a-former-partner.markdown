<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> My ex-girlfriend is now asking me to repay the money she voluntarily contributed to my education when we were still together. Can she legally demand that I pay her back?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> In general, financial contributions made voluntarily without an agreement for repayment are considered gifts. Under the law, a person who voluntarily helps another without expectation of repayment cannot legally demand the return of those contributions unless there was a clear agreement, such as a loan contract, between both parties. Your ex-girlfriend may have difficulty proving that the support was intended as a loan unless there is clear evidence of such an arrangement.</p>
