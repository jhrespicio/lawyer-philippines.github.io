<p>Social media platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, but they also pose certain risks, particularly regarding online scams. One common method employed by scammers is hijacking a person's social media account to impersonate them and deceive their friends or contacts. This often involves sending messages requesting money or other favors under the pretense of an emergency. To protect yourself from such scams, it is crucial to remain vigilant. Always verify the identity of the person you are communicating with, especially when money or sensitive information is involved. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your social media accounts to add an extra layer of security. Additionally, be cautious about the information you share online and regularly update your passwords. If you suspect that someone has hijacked your friend's account, report the incident to the social media platform immediately.</p>
