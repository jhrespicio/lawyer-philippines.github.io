<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>There is an incorrect letter in my nephew's name on an official document. How can we correct this mistake legally? What is the process?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, errors in civil registry documents, such as misspellings in names, can be corrected through an administrative process by filing a petition for correction of entry under Republic Act No. 9048. This law allows for the correction of clerical or typographical errors in the civil register without a judicial order. You can file the petition at the Local Civil Registrar where the document was registered. However, if the error is substantial (such as changing a first name or altering the identity), a court petition might be required. For simple clerical errors, the administrative process is quicker and more cost-effective.</p>
