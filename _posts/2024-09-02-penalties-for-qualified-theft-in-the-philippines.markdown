<p>Qualified theft is a serious offense in the Philippines, distinguished from simple theft by the circumstances under which it is committed. Under Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified theft occurs when the crime is committed with grave abuse of confidence or against certain persons, such as employers or relatives. The penalty for qualified theft is higher than that for simple theft and is determined based on the value of the stolen property. The penalty could range from prision mayor (6 years and 1 day to 12 years) to reclusion perpetua (20 years and 1 day to 40 years) if the value of the stolen property exceeds a certain threshold. The specific sentence is influenced by aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and the court has the discretion to impose a penalty within the prescribed range.</p>
