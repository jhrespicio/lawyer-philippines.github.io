<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If my father had children from a previous marriage and then remarried, do the children of his new wife from her first marriage have rights to my father's property?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, particularly the Civil Code, only the legitimate and illegitimate children of your father have the legal right to inherit his property. The children of your stepmother from her first marriage do not have any legal right to inherit from your father unless he has specifically named them in a will. Otherwise, inheritance rights are strictly confined to the direct descendants and, in some cases, the surviving spouse or parents. It is essential to verify whether your father left a will, as it would determine the specific inheritance arrangements, if any.</p>
