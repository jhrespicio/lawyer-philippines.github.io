<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I purchased a property for Php 200,000, and I would like to have a Deed of Absolute Sale notarized. Can you provide guidance on how much I should expect to pay for this service?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>The cost of notarizing a Deed of Absolute Sale in the Philippines typically depends on the value of the transaction and the local rates set by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) in your area. While there is no fixed national rate, notarization fees often range from Php 1,000 to Php 5,000 for transactions involving amounts similar to your purchase price. It is advisable to contact a local notary public to get an accurate estimate based on your location and the complexity of the document. Some notaries also charge a percentage of the transaction value, though this practice is less common.</p>
