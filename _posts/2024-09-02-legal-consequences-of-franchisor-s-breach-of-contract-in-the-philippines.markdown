<p>In the Philippines, franchising is governed by contract law, and a breach of contract by a franchisor can have significant legal implications. A breach occurs when the franchisor fails to uphold their contractual obligations, such as providing adequate support, protecting the franchisee's territory, or maintaining the brand's standards. When a breach happens, the franchisee has the right to seek legal remedies, which may include rescission of the contract, where the franchise agreement is terminated, and the franchisee is relieved of their obligations. Additionally, the franchisee may claim damages for any financial losses incurred due to the franchisor's breach.
