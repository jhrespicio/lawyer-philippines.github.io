<p>In the Philippines, threats made within school environments, particularly those involving minors, are taken seriously. When a student is threatened by another student's parent, this can escalate into a community issue requiring intervention. Barangay mediation serves as an accessible mechanism for resolving such disputes without immediate recourse to legal action. The barangay officials, through the Lupong Tagapamayapa, can facilitate dialogue between the parties involved, focusing on conflict resolution and the welfare of the children. This approach emphasizes restorative justice, aiming to repair relationships and maintain peace within the community. If the threat is severe and poses a real danger, the incident can be reported to the police, and the legal process can proceed concurrently with or after the barangay mediation. The goal is to protect the well-being of the students while fostering a peaceful resolution.</p>
