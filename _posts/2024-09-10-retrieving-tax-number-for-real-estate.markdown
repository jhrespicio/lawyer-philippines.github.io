<p>Dear Attorney,</p><p>We have misplaced the copy of our tax number for a real estate property, and we would like to retrieve it. How can we go about obtaining a copy of this information?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>To retrieve your tax number (TIN) or other tax-related documents, you will need to approach the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) or your local Revenue District Office (RDO). You may be asked to provide valid identification and other documentation proving ownership of the property. If the tax number is related to real estate taxes, the local government unit’s Assessor’s Office where the property is located might also help. Ensure that you have prepared the necessary documents such as a valid ID, property title, or any existing tax records.</p>
