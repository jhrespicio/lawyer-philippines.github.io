<p>Organizational restructuring is a common practice in businesses aiming to improve efficiency or adapt to changing market conditions. However, in the Philippines, the process must be handled with careful consideration of employee rights, particularly when it involves demotion. The Labor Code of the Philippines does not explicitly prohibit demotion, but it does require that any significant changes to an employee's status, including demotion, must be justifiable and communicated properly.</p><p>Employers must have a valid legal reason for demoting an employee, such as redundancy or the employee's inability to perform the duties of their current position. Moreover, the demotion should not be used as a form of punishment or without due process. Employees have the right to be informed about the reasons for their demotion and should be given an opportunity to discuss these reasons with their employer.</p><p>Failure to communicate and negotiate the terms of a demotion can lead to claims of constructive dismissal, where an employee may argue that the demotion was a form of illegal termination. To avoid legal disputes, employers should ensure transparency and fairness during the restructuring process, and consider alternative solutions such as retraining or reassignment before deciding on a demotion. If a demoted employee believes their rights have been violated, they may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for investigation and possible resolution.</p>
