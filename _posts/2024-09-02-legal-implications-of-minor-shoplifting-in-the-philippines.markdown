<p>In the Philippines, shoplifting is classified as theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code. Regardless of the value of the item stolen, shoplifting is considered a criminal offense. Minor shoplifting refers to theft involving items of relatively low value, but it is still punishable by law. The penalties for shoplifting can range from arresto menor (imprisonment for one day to 30 days) to prision correccional (imprisonment from six months and one day to six years), depending on the circumstances, including the value of the stolen goods and any prior criminal record of the offender.</p><p>Shoplifters may also be subject to civil liability, where they are required to pay the value of the stolen items and potentially additional damages to the store owner. Moreover, habitual shoplifters, or those with repeated offenses, may face more severe penalties. It is important for individuals to understand that even minor acts of shoplifting carry serious consequences under Philippine law, including both criminal and civil liabilities.</p>
