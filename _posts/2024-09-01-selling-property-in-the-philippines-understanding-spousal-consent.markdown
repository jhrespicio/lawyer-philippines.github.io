<p>In the Philippines, when dealing with property transactions, the marital status of the parties involved plays a significant role. If a property was acquired before one of the co-owners got married, it is considered part of that person's exclusive property. However, if the property is now being sold, and the co-owner has since married, the consent of the spouse is generally required, particularly if the property is now classified as conjugal or community property under the Family Code. The spouseâ€™s consent is typically documented in a notarized document attached to the Deed of Sale. This legal requirement ensures that the spouse is aware of and agrees to the sale, thereby protecting the rights of both parties in the marriage. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to determine the exact legal requirements for your specific situation.</p>
