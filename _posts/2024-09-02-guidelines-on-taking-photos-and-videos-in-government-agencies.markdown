<p>In the Philippines, taking photos or videos within government offices such as the Pag-IBIG Fund, SSS, or other agencies is generally allowed, but with certain limitations. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) emphasizes the protection of personal data, which includes unauthorized capturing and sharing of images or videos that might infringe on individuals' privacy. Many government offices may have specific rules or require permission before taking photos or videos, especially in areas where sensitive information is handled. To avoid legal issues, it is advisable to seek permission from the relevant authorities or check the officeâ€™s policy before recording. Moreover, one should be mindful not to capture and share content that could violate others' privacy or disrupt government operations.</p>
