<p>Misappropriation of company funds, also known as embezzlement, is a serious offense in the Philippines. Under the Revised Penal Code, this act is classified as <i>estafa</i> or swindling, which involves deceit and financial misconduct. An individual who takes company funds for personal use, even with the intention of returning them, may still be charged with <i>estafa</i> if they fail to return the full amount or if the company suffers losses as a result.</p><p>When a person is caught using company funds without proper authorization, the company may initiate both criminal and civil actions. In criminal cases, the accused can face penalties including imprisonment and fines, depending on the amount misappropriated and the circumstances of the offense. Civil liability may also arise, where the company can demand restitution for the amount taken, along with damages for any harm caused.</p><p>Employers have the right to take disciplinary action against employees found guilty of such acts. This can include termination of employment, especially if the breach of trust is severe. The gravity of the offense and the amount involved will significantly influence the legal consequences and the penalties imposed.</p><p>It is crucial for employees to understand that even if the intent was to temporarily use the funds and later return them, the act is still illegal. The best course of action is to avoid any unauthorized use of company funds and to seek proper approval for any financial transactions that may fall outside the usual scope of work responsibilities.</p>
