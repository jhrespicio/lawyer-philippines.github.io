Understanding the legal requirements for such processes is crucial to ensure that documents are legally binding and recognized in the jurisdiction where they are executed.</p><p>The Philippines follows the principle that documents executed abroad must undergo a process of authentication before they can be used or recognized in the country. This process typically involves the document being signed and notarized by a notary public in the foreign country, followed by authentication by the Philippine Consulate or Embassy in that country.
