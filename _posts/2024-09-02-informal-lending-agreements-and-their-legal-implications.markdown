<p>Informal lending agreements, especially those made without written documentation, are common in the Philippines. However, such arrangements can lead to complications if the borrower fails to repay the loan. In the absence of a written contract, the lender may find it challenging to prove the existence and terms of the loan if the matter escalates to a legal dispute. Under Philippine law, verbal agreements are binding, but they are harder to enforce compared to written contracts. To protect both parties, it is advisable to document any loan agreement, even through a simple promissory note. This document should outline the amount loaned, the interest rate (if any), the repayment schedule, and the consequences of default. If a dispute arises, having a written agreement provides clear evidence of the terms and can facilitate a quicker resolution. In the absence of a written contract, the lender may need to rely on other forms of evidence, such as witness testimony or records of communication, to prove the loanâ€™s existence and terms.</p>
