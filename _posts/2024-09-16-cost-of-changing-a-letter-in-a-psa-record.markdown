<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recently noticed that my birth certificate has a typographical error, and I need to change one letter. Could you advise how much it would cost to have this corrected in the PSA?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The cost of correcting clerical errors such as a letter in a PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority) document depends on the nature of the correction. If it qualifies as a minor clerical error, the process will typically fall under Republic Act No. 9048, which allows the local civil registrar to make administrative corrections. The cost may vary depending on the local government unit's fees, but generally, the fee ranges between PHP 1,000 to PHP 3,000. It's best to inquire directly at your local civil registry for the most accurate cost estimate.</p>
