The services include legal advice, mediation, and assistance in filing complaints with the appropriate labor tribunals. In some cases, DOLE can also provide representation in hearings before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).</p><p>To access these services, workers can visit the nearest DOLE office or contact their hotline.
