<p>In the Philippines, the preparation and submission of a barangay's annual budget is one of the key responsibilities of the Punong Barangay (Barangay Captain). The Local Government Code mandates that each barangay must prepare an annual budget to ensure the proper allocation of funds for its various programs and projects. Failure to prepare and submit the annual budget can lead to administrative sanctions against the Punong Barangay. These sanctions may include suspension or removal from office, depending on the severity of the violation. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) monitors compliance with budget preparation and may initiate proceedings against a non-compliant Barangay Captain. It is crucial for barangay officials to adhere to the legal requirements for budget preparation to avoid disruptions in local governance and to ensure the continued delivery of services to their constituents.</p>
