<p>In the Philippines, an exit clearance is a document that an employer may require from an employee who is leaving the company, usually as a prerequisite for the release of the final pay, including back wages, tax refunds, and other benefits. The exit clearance typically confirms that the employee has returned all company property, settled any obligations, and completed any pending tasks.</p><p>Even if an employee does not have a formal written contract, the employer may still require an exit clearance, especially if company policies or the terms of employment mentioned during the hiring process include this requirement. However, the absence of a written contract does not absolve the employee from complying with company policies related to resignation or termination.</p><p>If an employee believes that the requirement for an exit clearance is unjustified, particularly if no contract exists, they may raise the issue with the employer. If the employer insists on the clearance without a valid basis, the employee may seek assistance from the DOLE. It is essential for employees to understand their rights and obligations upon separation from the company to avoid potential legal issues.</p>
