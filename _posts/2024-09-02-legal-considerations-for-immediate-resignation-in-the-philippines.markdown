<p>In the Philippines, an employee may resign immediately if justified by circumstances such as serious illness, breach of employment contract by the employer, or any analogous circumstances that significantly affect the employee's well-being. However, immediate resignation must be communicated formally to the employer, and in some cases, it requires approval from higher management or the appropriate authorities within the company. The failure to secure necessary approvals or to follow company protocols can lead to complications, such as deductions from the final pay due to the unserved notice period. It is crucial to understand that resignation does not take effect automatically upon submission of the resignation letter; the process may involve validation and approval by the employer. Employees are advised to consult their companyâ€™s policies or seek legal advice to ensure compliance with proper procedures, thereby avoiding potential issues related to final pay and employment records.</p>
