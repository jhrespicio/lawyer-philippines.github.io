<p>In the Philippines, many business partnerships start informally, without written agreements. While this may seem convenient at the outset, the lack of formal documentation can lead to significant legal challenges if disputes arise. Under Philippine law, a partnership exists when two or more persons agree to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves. Even without a written contract, an oral agreement or the mere conduct of business together can establish a partnership.</p><p>When disputes occur in such informal arrangements, the aggrieved party has several legal options. Firstly, they may seek to prove the existence of the partnership through evidence such as financial records, communication between the parties, and testimonies. Once the partnership is established, the partner can demand an accounting of the partnership's assets and liabilities. This process can reveal whether there has been a mismanagement of funds or whether the partnership has any outstanding debts.</p><p>If one partner acts in bad faith—such as by coercing the other into signing an unfavorable agreement or by harassing them—the aggrieved party may file a case for annulment of the contract, damages, or both. The courts will examine the circumstances surrounding the signing of any agreement and whether there was undue influence or coercion. Moreover, the partner can also seek injunctive relief to prevent further harassment or damage to their reputation.</p><p>Public Attorneys' Offices (PAO) provide free legal assistance to those who cannot afford private counsel. This is a valuable resource for individuals who find themselves in a legal dispute but lack the financial means to hire a lawyer. In cases where a partner is being wrongfully excluded from a business or their rights are being violated, they should consult with a lawyer as soon as possible to explore all available remedies under the law.</p>
