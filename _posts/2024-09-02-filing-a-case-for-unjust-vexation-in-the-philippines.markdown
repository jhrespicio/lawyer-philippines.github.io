<p>Unjust vexation is a criminal offense under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, specifically under Article 287. It covers acts that are annoying, irritating, or distressing without any legitimate purpose. The offense is subjective, meaning that the impact on the victim is considered rather than the intent of the perpetrator. In situations where an individual behaves inappropriately, such as exposing themselves while intoxicated, the victim may file a complaint for unjust vexation. The process involves reporting the incident to the police or the barangay, where the complaint will be documented. The case may then be escalated to the court if warranted. Conviction for unjust vexation can lead to penalties, including imprisonment or a fine, depending on the circumstances and severity of the offense. Victims are encouraged to document the incident and seek immediate legal assistance to ensure proper action is taken.</p>
