<p>Receiving harassing and threatening text messages is a form of cyber harassment that is punishable under Philippine law. The Anti-Cybercrime Law (Republic Act No. 10175) provides legal remedies for victims of such acts. The law criminalizes cyberstalking, harassment, and other forms of misuse of technology to harm or threaten individuals.</p><p>Victims of harassing or threatening text messages should document all communications and report the incidents to the local authorities, such as the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Cybercrime Division. Filing a formal complaint may lead to an investigation, and if the perpetrator is identified, they could face criminal charges, including imprisonment and fines.</p><p>Additionally, the victim may seek a protection order from the court to prevent further harassment. This legal measure can provide immediate relief by legally prohibiting the harasser from contacting the victim. Legal assistance is crucial in ensuring that the complaint is properly filed and that the victim's rights are protected throughout the process.</p>
