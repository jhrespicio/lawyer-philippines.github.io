<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My previous employer did not remit my SSS contributions. What can I do to address this issue?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Employers in the Philippines are legally obligated to remit Social Security System (SSS) contributions for their employees. Failure to do so is a violation of the Social Security Act of 1997. As an employee, you can file a complaint with the SSS against your previous employer for non-remittance of contributions. The SSS will investigate the matter and can compel the employer to remit the unpaid contributions along with penalties and interest. Additionally, employers who fail to remit SSS contributions may face criminal charges and be subject to fines or imprisonment. It is advisable to keep records of your employment and pay slips as evidence when filing your complaint with the SSS.</p>
