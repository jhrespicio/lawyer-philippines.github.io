<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I recently went AWOL (Absent Without Leave) from my job. Am I still entitled to receive the salary for the period before I went AWOL?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Even if you went AWOL from your job, you are still entitled to receive the wages for the work you have already completed prior to going AWOL. In the Philippines, labor laws mandate that employees must be paid for the work they have performed. Employers are required to release any unpaid salary up until the last day you rendered your services. However, going AWOL may affect other benefits, such as severance pay or the release of your final paycheck. It is advisable to address any issues with your employer to resolve the situation amicably and ensure that all dues are settled.</p>
