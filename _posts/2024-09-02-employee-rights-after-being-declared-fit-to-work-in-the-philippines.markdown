<p>Employees in the Philippines who have been declared fit to work by a medical professional have the legal right to return to their job, provided they meet the conditions set by their employer's return-to-work policies. If an employee is denied entry to the workplace despite having a clearance from a licensed physician, this may constitute an unlawful dismissal or discrimination.</p><p>The Labor Code of the Philippines, along with various labor regulations, protects employees from unjust termination. A fitness-to-work certification from a medical professional, particularly a specialist like a cardiologist, serves as a valid document proving the employee's capability to resume their duties. Employers are generally required to honor such certifications unless there are compelling reasons to dispute them, such as inconsistencies or doubts about the employee's actual health condition.</p><p>If an employee is wrongfully denied the right to work, they may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or seek redress through the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The employee may be entitled to reinstatement, back wages, or other forms of compensation if the dismissal is found to be unjust.</p><p>It is advisable for employees to document all communications with their employer regarding their medical condition and fitness to work, as this evidence may be crucial in any legal proceedings.</p>
