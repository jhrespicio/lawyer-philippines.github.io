<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I am currently unable to repay a debt that I owe. What are my options and the possible consequences under Philippine law?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, failure to pay a debt does not automatically result in imprisonment, as it is not considered a criminal offense under the law. However, creditors may pursue civil actions against you, such as filing a collection suit in court. If a court judgment is rendered against you, it may lead to wage garnishment or the seizure of assets to satisfy the debt. It's crucial to communicate with your creditor to explore possible repayment plans or settlements to avoid legal action.</p>
