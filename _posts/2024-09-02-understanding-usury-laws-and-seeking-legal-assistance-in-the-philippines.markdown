<p>Usury, or the practice of charging excessive interest rates on loans, is regulated under Philippine law. While the Usury Law, which set specific interest rate limits, has been effectively suspended by Central Bank Circular No. 905 in 1982, the practice of charging unconscionable interest rates can still be challenged under the Civil Code of the Philippines, particularly under the provisions on contracts and obligations.</p><p>The law provides that interest rates should not be excessive or iniquitous. If a borrower believes that the interest rate imposed on a loan is unconscionable, they may seek legal recourse. Courts in the Philippines have the authority to reduce excessive interest rates to reasonable levels, based on the circumstances of the case and prevailing market conditions.</p><p>Individuals facing issues related to usury should consider seeking legal advice to explore their options. Legal professionals specializing in financial and contract law can provide guidance on whether the interest rates in question may be considered usurious and can assist in negotiating more favorable terms or in filing a legal complaint if necessary.</p><p>It is essential to gather all relevant documents, such as the loan agreement and any communications with the lender, to build a strong case. Legal assistance can help ensure that the borrowerâ€™s rights are protected and that any unjust practices are appropriately addressed.</p><p>For those in need of legal assistance, seeking a lawyer with expertise in financial law or contacting local legal aid organizations may be beneficial. These professionals can offer the necessary support to navigate the complexities of usury law in the Philippines.</p>
