<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Can an audio recording of my testimony be used as evidence in court if I did not consent to the recording and was unaware that I was being recorded?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, the use of audio recordings as evidence without the consent of the individual being recorded can be a violation of the Anti-Wiretapping Law (RA 4200). The law prohibits the recording of private communications without the consent of all parties involved. Therefore, if the recording was obtained without your consent, it may be deemed inadmissible in court. However, the court may still admit the recording depending on how it was obtained and the nature of the case. It's best to consult a lawyer for case-specific advice, as each situation may differ in its application of the law.</p>
