<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>We would like to request assistance in drafting an Extrajudicial Settlement (EJS) with a waiver of rights. Can you guide us through the process and help ensure that it complies with legal requirements?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>An Extrajudicial Settlement of estate is an agreement among the heirs of a deceased person on how the estate will be divided among them. A waiver of rights, on the other hand, is when one or more heirs voluntarily waive their share in favor of another heir or beneficiary. The EJS must be prepared and signed by all heirs and should be published in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive weeks as required by law.</p><p>It is crucial to consult with a lawyer to ensure the document is legally sound and all heirsâ€™ rights are respected. The lawyer can also assist in filing the settlement with the appropriate court and guide you through the process to avoid future legal complications.</p>
