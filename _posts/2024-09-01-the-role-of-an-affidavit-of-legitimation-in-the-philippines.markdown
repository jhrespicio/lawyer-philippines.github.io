<p>In the Philippines, an Affidavit of Legitimation is a legal document used in the process of legitimating a child who was born out of wedlock. Legitimation is a process by which a child born to parents who were not legally married at the time of the child's birth is granted the status of legitimacy, provided that the parents subsequently marry each other and no legal impediment to their marriage existed at the time of the child’s birth.</p><p>Legitimation has important legal implications for the child, particularly regarding their rights to inheritance, the use of the father’s surname, and other legal benefits associated with legitimate children. The affidavit serves as a formal declaration by the parents, stating the circumstances of the child’s birth and their subsequent marriage, which brings about the legitimation.</p><p>The affidavit typically includes details such as the full names of the parents, the date and place of the child’s birth, the date and place of the parents' marriage, and a statement that there was no legal impediment to the marriage at the time the child was born. This document is usually accompanied by the marriage certificate and the child’s birth certificate.</p><p>To obtain an Affidavit of Legitimation, parents usually need to go to a notary public or a lawyer who can draft the document according to the legal requirements. Once notarized, the affidavit, along with other supporting documents, is submitted to the local civil registry where the child’s birth was recorded. The civil registry will then annotate the birth certificate to reflect the legitimation.</p><p>Legitimation is a significant legal process that confers full rights to a child as if they were born to married parents. Parents who wish to legitimate their child should ensure that they comply with all the legal requirements and consult with legal professionals to facilitate the process.</p>
