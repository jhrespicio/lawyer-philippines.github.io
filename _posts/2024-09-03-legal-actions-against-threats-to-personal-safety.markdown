<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>A person has threatened our family, telling us to be careful with our actions. What legal actions can we take against this person?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Threats to personal safety are taken seriously under Philippine law. The Revised Penal Code penalizes individuals who make threats against another person's life or property. You can file a complaint for grave threats if the person has made serious threats that instill fear of harm or injury to you or your family. It is important to document the threat, including any witnesses or evidence such as text messages, emails, or recordings. You may also consider filing a police report to have the threat on record. If the threats persist or escalate, you may seek a protection order from the court to ensure your family's safety.</p>
