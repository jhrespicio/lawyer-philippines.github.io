<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I currently have an unpaid credit card balance amounting to ₱59,000. I’ve been making regular payments, but the third-party collector insists that I pay the full amount immediately. What should I do?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>It is important to know your rights as a debtor when dealing with third-party collection agencies. Collection agencies cannot force you to pay the full amount if you are unable to do so. Under the Financial Consumer Protection Act, third-party collectors are also bound by certain ethical guidelines, which prohibit them from using abusive, deceptive, or unfair practices.</p><p>If you cannot pay the balance in full, you may negotiate for a payment plan that fits your financial capacity. Document all communications with the collector, and if you believe their behavior is abusive, you can file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), depending on the nature of the collector.</p>
