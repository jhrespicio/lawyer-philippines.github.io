<p>In the Philippines, inheritance rights are governed by the Civil Code and various related laws. Legitimate heirs, such as spouses, children, and, in some cases, parents and siblings, have legal rights to claim their share of the deceased's estate. These shares are determined based on compulsory heirship, which dictates that certain portions of the estate are reserved by law for specific heirs. The share each heir is entitled to depends on whether the deceased left a will, the number of heirs, and the relationship of each heir to the deceased.</p><p>If a person believes they have been unfairly deprived of their inheritance rights, they may contest the distribution of the estate through legal means. This may involve filing a case in court to assert their rightful share. It is important to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific rights and legal procedures involved in claiming an inheritance share, as the process can be complex and time-sensitive.</p>
