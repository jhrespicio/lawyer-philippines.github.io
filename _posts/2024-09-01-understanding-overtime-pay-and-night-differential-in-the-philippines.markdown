<p>In the Philippines, employees are entitled to additional compensation for overtime work and night shifts under the Labor Code of the Philippines. Overtime pay is required when an employee works beyond the standard eight-hour workday, and it must be compensated at a rate of at least 25% more than the employee&#39;s regular wage. On the other hand, night differential pay is mandated for work performed between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM, with an additional pay of not less than 10% of the regular wage for each hour of work performed during this period. Employers are obligated to comply with these provisions to ensure fair compensation for employees who work beyond normal working hours or during the night. Violations of these labor standards can result in penalties and legal action against the employer. It is essential for employees to understand their rights under the law and for employers to adhere to these regulations to maintain fair and just workplace practices.</p>
