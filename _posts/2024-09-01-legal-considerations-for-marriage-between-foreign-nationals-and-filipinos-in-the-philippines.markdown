<p>When a foreign national marries a Filipino in the Philippines, the marriage is governed by Philippine laws. The couple must comply with the legal requirements for marriage, including securing a marriage license, undergoing pre-marriage counseling, and ensuring that any previous marriages have been legally annulled or dissolved. Additionally, if the foreign national intends to live in the Philippines, they may need to obtain the appropriate visa. The marriage will be recognized in the Philippines, and the foreign national may also need to register the marriage with their home country's embassy or consulate. Legal advice may be necessary to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and to address any specific concerns related to the foreign spouse's nationality.</p>
