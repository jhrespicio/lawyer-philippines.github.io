<p>In the Philippines, forced resignation is considered a form of constructive dismissal, which occurs when an employee is compelled to resign due to unbearable working conditions or undue pressure from the employer. The Labor Code and various labor laws provide protections for employees against constructive dismissal, ensuring that workers are not unfairly coerced into resigning from their positions.</p><p>Constructive dismissal may occur in situations where an employee is subjected to harassment, discrimination, demotion without just cause, or intolerable work conditions that leave them with no choice but to resign. If an employee believes they have been constructively dismissed, they may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The burden of proof lies with the employee to demonstrate that the resignation was not voluntary but was forced by the employer's actions.</p><p>If the NLRC or a labor arbiter finds that the resignation was indeed forced, the employee may be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights, back wages, and other forms of compensation. Employers are advised to handle employee resignations with care and to ensure that their actions do not create conditions that could be construed as constructive dismissal.</p>
