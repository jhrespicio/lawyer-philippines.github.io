<p>In the Philippines, a tax declaration is often misunderstood as proof of ownership of real property. However, it is crucial to recognize that a tax declaration is not equivalent to a land title. A tax declaration is a document issued by the local government, primarily for the purpose of taxation. It indicates that the declared owner is paying taxes on the property, but it does not establish ownership. The primary purpose of a tax declaration is to ensure that the government can collect the appropriate real estate taxes on the property. Ownership of land, on the other hand, is best evidenced by a Torrens title, which is issued by the Register of Deeds. Without a land title, claims of ownership can be tenuous and subject to dispute. Individuals holding only a tax declaration should consider legal steps to secure a title, especially if they have been in possession of the land for an extended period under conditions that might qualify them for a land title, such as through acquisitive prescription.</p>
