<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>One of my colleagues filed a complaint against me with the grievance committee, accusing me of shouting at them and belittling their character. I believe this is not an accurate representation of the situation. What are my rights in this case, and how should I respond to this complaint?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under the Philippine Labor Code, employees are protected against unfair treatment and false accusations. If you are accused of misconduct, it is essential that due process be followed. This means that you must be notified of the complaint and given an opportunity to present your side in a formal hearing. You can provide evidence or witnesses to support your defense. The grievance committee is tasked with ensuring a fair resolution based on the merits of the case. Ensure that you maintain professionalism throughout the process and seek legal advice to protect your rights.</p>
