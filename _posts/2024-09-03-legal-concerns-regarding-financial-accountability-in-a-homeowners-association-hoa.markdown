<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of the members of our non-profit Homeowners' Association (HOA). The previous set of officers did not turn over the financial report when their term ended. There were monetary donations received from the developer by the former officers, and our members want to know how these funds were used. However, the current officers are considering writing off the matter because the previous officers are not cooperating. Is this course of action appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The lack of a financial report turnover and the allegations of misappropriation are serious concerns that require a thorough investigation. Writing off the matter without a clear accounting could lead to potential legal liabilities for the current officers and the HOA as a whole. The current officers have a fiduciary duty to the association and its members, which includes ensuring transparency and accountability regarding the association's finances.</p>
<p>The HOA may need to take legal steps to compel the previous officers to provide the necessary financial documentation. This can include sending a formal demand letter, and if non-compliance persists, pursuing legal action through the appropriate court. It is also advisable to consult with a legal professional to explore all possible avenues for recovering the financial records and ensuring that any alleged misappropriation is properly addressed.</p>
<p>In summary, simply writing off the matter is not advisable. The current officers should exhaust all legal remedies to obtain the financial records and address the members' concerns.</p>
