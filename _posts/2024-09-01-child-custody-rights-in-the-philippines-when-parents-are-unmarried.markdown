<p>In the Philippines, child custody issues involving unmarried parents can be complex, especially when one parent is abroad. Under Philippine law, particularly the Family Code, the custody of illegitimate children is generally awarded to the mother. This is because the law presumes that the mother is the child&#39;s natural guardian, providing the child with the necessary care and attention. However, if the mother is unable to care for the child due to being abroad or other circumstances, the court may consider the best interest of the child in determining custody. The father may petition the court for custody or visitation rights, but he must demonstrate that such an arrangement would be in the child&#39;s best interest. Additionally, the involvement of the child&#39;s maternal grandparents, especially if they have been the primary caregivers, could be a significant factor in the court&#39;s decision. Ultimately, the court&#39;s primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the child, and custody arrangements will be made accordingly.</p>
