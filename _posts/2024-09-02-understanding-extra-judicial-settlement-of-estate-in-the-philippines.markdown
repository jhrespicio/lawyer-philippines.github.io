<p>An Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate is a legal process in the Philippines used to divide and distribute the assets of a deceased person who did not leave a will. This process is typically used when the heirs are in agreement on how to divide the estate and wish to avoid a lengthy court process. The following are the key steps and requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Heirs’ Agreement:</strong> All legal heirs must agree on the division of the estate. If there are minor heirs involved, the process may require court approval.</li><li><strong>Execution of the Settlement Agreement:</strong> The heirs will execute a document known as the “Deed of Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate.” This document must be notarized and signed by all the heirs.</li><li><strong>Publication Requirement:</strong> The settlement must be published in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive weeks. This is to inform the public of the settlement and allow any potential creditors to make claims against the estate.</li><li><strong>Payment of Estate Taxes:</strong> The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) requires the payment of estate taxes before the property can be transferred. The BIR will issue a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) upon payment.</li><li><strong>Transfer of Ownership:</strong> Once the CAR is obtained, the heirs can proceed to transfer the property titles to their names at the Register of Deeds and update the tax declaration at the local assessor’s office.</li></ul><p>Extra-Judicial Settlement is often the preferred method for heirs to divide an estate due to its relatively straightforward and cost-effective nature compared to judicial proceedings.</p>
