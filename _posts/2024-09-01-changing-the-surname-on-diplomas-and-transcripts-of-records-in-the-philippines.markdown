<p>In the Philippines, changing the surname on official documents such as diplomas and transcripts of records (TOR) is a process that may be necessary due to various reasons, such as marriage, annulment, or legal adoption. The process typically begins with securing a court order authorizing the name change. This court order must be presented to the educational institution that issued the diploma or TOR. Along with the court order, you may also need to submit other supporting documents, such as a marriage certificate, if the change is due to marriage. The institution will then issue new documents reflecting the updated surname. It is important to note that the process may vary slightly depending on the policies of the educational institution and the reason for the name change. Ensuring that all required documents are correctly submitted will help in avoiding delays in the processing of the request.</p>
