<p>A preliminary hearing in the Small Claims Court of the Philippines is a crucial stage in legal proceedings, especially for cases involving minor financial disputes. During this hearing, both parties are required to present their evidence and arguments before the court. The primary purpose of the preliminary hearing is to determine whether the case has enough merit to proceed to a full trial. The judge may also attempt to mediate between the parties to reach an amicable settlement without the need for further court sessions. It is vital to attend the scheduled preliminary hearing, as failure to do so may result in a default judgment against the absent party or even the issuance of a warrant of arrest if mandated by law. Ensuring attendance and compliance with court orders during this stage is essential to avoid any legal repercussions and to facilitate the smooth progression of the case.</p>
