<p>Renters in the Philippines have the right to a safe and habitable living environment. If a rented property is found to be in poor condition, such as having pests, foul odors, or unsafe living conditions, tenants can take several steps to address the issue.</p><ul><li><strong>Notify the Landlord:</strong> The first step is to notify the landlord or property manager about the issues. This should be done in writing to create a record of the complaint.</li><li><strong>Request for Repairs:</strong> Tenants can formally request that the landlord make necessary repairs to bring the property up to standard. The landlord is legally obligated to maintain the premises in a livable condition.</li><li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> If the landlord fails to address the problems, tenants may consider legal action. They can file a complaint with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) or take the matter to court. The tenant may also have the right to terminate the lease without penalty if the property is uninhabitable.</li><li><strong>Document the Condition:</strong> It is crucial for tenants to document the poor conditions through photographs, videos, and written records. These can serve as evidence if the dispute escalates to legal proceedings.</li><li><strong>Withholding Rent:</strong> In some cases, tenants may be able to withhold rent until the landlord makes the necessary repairs. However, this should be done cautiously and usually with legal advice, as it may lead to eviction if not handled properly.</li></ul><p>Renters should be aware of their rights and seek legal advice when necessary to ensure they are living in a safe and healthy environment.</p>
