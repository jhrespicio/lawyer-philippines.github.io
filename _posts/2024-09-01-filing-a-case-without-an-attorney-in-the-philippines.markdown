<p>While having legal representation is highly recommended, it is possible to file a case in the Philippines without an attorney. The Supreme Court of the Philippines provides for small claims procedures, where individuals can file a case without the need for a lawyer, particularly for monetary claims within a certain threshold. However, for more complex cases, such as criminal cases or significant civil suits, it is advisable to seek legal assistance to ensure proper legal procedure is followed. The Public Attorney's Office (PAO) provides free legal assistance to indigent individuals, and they can help with the preparation and filing of cases. Additionally, some law schools offer legal aid clinics where law students, under the supervision of licensed attorneys, provide free legal services.</p>
