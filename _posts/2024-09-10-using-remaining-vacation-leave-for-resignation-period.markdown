<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Is it allowed to use my remaining vacation leave to cover the rendering of my resignation period?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Yes, it is possible to use your remaining vacation leave credits during the rendering of your resignation period, provided that your employer allows it. Under Philippine labor laws, employees are generally required to give a 30-day notice before resignation. However, the use of leave credits within this period is subject to the employer’s approval. You may wish to formally request to use your vacation leave credits during this time, and if approved, it can offset the number of days required for your notice period. Make sure to check your company’s policies or employment contract for specific guidelines on leave usage during resignation.</p>
