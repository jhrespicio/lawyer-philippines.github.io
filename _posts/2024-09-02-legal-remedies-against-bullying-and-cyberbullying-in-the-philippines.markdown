<p>Bullying and cyberbullying are serious issues that can have long-lasting effects on the victims, especially among the youth. In the Philippines, the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10627) was enacted to address these concerns within educational institutions. The law mandates schools to adopt policies to prevent and address bullying and requires them to establish mechanisms for reporting and investigating bullying incidents.</p><p>If a student is being bullied or cyberbullied, the first course of action is to report the incident to the school administration, specifically the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) or its equivalent. Schools are required to take immediate steps to protect the victim and investigate the allegations. If the school fails to act or if the bullying persists, parents or guardians can escalate the matter by filing a complaint with the Department of Education (DepEd) or, in severe cases, seek the assistance of local authorities such as the barangay or the Philippine National Police (PNP).</p><p>Victims of cyberbullying may also explore remedies under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175), which penalizes acts of cyber libel, harassment, and identity theft. Filing a formal complaint with the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division can help in addressing cyberbullying cases.</p><p>Parents should gather evidence such as screenshots, messages, and witness statements to support their case. Legal consultation with a lawyer experienced in handling bullying and cyberbullying cases is recommended to understand the legal options and pursue justice for the victim.</p>
