<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>We are planning to purchase a property, but the title is still under the name of the first owner, and it has not yet been transferred to the current owner, who is the seller. Is it safe to proceed with the purchase?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Purchasing a property where the title is not yet transferred to the current owner poses significant risks. Before proceeding, it is crucial to ensure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. This typically requires that the title be transferred into their name first. The best course of action would be for the seller to complete the transfer process before finalizing the sale. Alternatively, you can place a condition in the contract stating that the sale will only be completed once the title has been properly transferred to the seller. It is advisable to have a lawyer review all documents and guide you through the proper process to avoid legal complications.</p>
