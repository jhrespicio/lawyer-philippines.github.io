<p>In the Philippines, changing a child's surname is a legal process that involves several steps and requires compliance with specific laws. One of the common scenarios for requesting a surname change is when a mother, who was unmarried at the time of the child’s birth, wishes to change the child’s surname to her maiden name. According to the Family Code of the Philippines, a legitimate child shall primarily use the surname of the father. However, for illegitimate children, the default surname is that of the mother, unless the father recognizes the child and consents to the use of his surname.</p><p>If a mother wishes to change the child’s surname from the father’s to her maiden name, she must file a petition for a change of name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court. The petition is filed in the Regional Trial Court of the city or municipality where the child resides. The court will evaluate the petition based on the merits and consider the best interests of the child. The petition must include valid reasons for the change, such as the father’s abandonment or failure to provide support.</p><p>It is essential to understand that the process of changing a child’s surname can be complex and may require legal assistance to ensure that all procedural requirements are met and that the child’s rights are protected throughout the process.</p>
