<p>Under Philippine labor laws, particularly the Labor Code of the Philippines, employees are entitled to certain leave benefits, including vacation and sick leave credits. These leave credits accumulate over time and must be duly compensated by the employer. If an employee has not received their entitled leave credits, they have the right to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Employers are obligated to comply with the provisions of the law regarding the accrual and payment of leave credits, and failure to do so may result in legal penalties. It is important for employees to keep track of their leave credits and raise any discrepancies with their human resources department before escalating the issue to the DOLE.</p>
