<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have concerns regarding my employment situation and would like to file a complaint. What is the process for filing a complaint against my employer?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><brFiling a complaint about employment issues can be done through the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). You may file a formal complaint regarding labor violations such as non-payment of wages, illegal dismissal, or workplace harassment. Start by visiting the nearest DOLE office or filing online through DOLEâ€™s Single Entry Approach (SEnA) mechanism. This approach provides mediation between the employee and employer before escalating the case to formal litigation. Ensure that you gather all relevant documentation, such as employment contracts, payslips, or evidence of misconduct, to support your case.</p>
