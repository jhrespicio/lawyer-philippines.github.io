<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have been working as a security guard for three years, but I was immediately removed from my post without being informed of my mistake. What can I do?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, security guards, like any other employees, are protected under the Labor Code. Employers cannot just terminate an employee without valid grounds and due process. As a security guard, you have the right to be informed of the charges or reasons for your termination. The due process involves giving you a chance to explain your side through a notice of dismissal and a hearing. If these procedures were not followed, you may have been wrongfully dismissed. You can file a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). It's best to seek legal advice to assist you in this process and protect your rights as a worker.</p>
