<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My father works for the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), but he has not received his salary since September 2023. What actions can he take to resolve this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Non-payment of salaries for government employees is a serious concern and may violate the Civil Service Commission (CSC) rules. Your father can file a formal complaint with the CSC, or he may escalate the matter to the Commission on Audit (COA), which oversees the release and accounting of government funds. Additionally, it may be helpful to inquire with the HR or payroll department of the DPWH to determine the cause of the delay. If no resolution is forthcoming, your father may consult with a lawyer to explore further legal remedies, such as filing a case for unpaid wages, ensuring his rights as a government employee are protected.</p>
