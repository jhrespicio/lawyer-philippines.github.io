<p>Under Philippine labor laws, employees are entitled to overtime pay when they work beyond their regular working hours. However, the situation becomes more complex when an employee arrives late and is asked to extend their working hours to compensate for the time lost. The key factor in determining whether overtime pay is applicable is the total number of hours worked. If the employee's extended hours result in work beyond the standard eight-hour workday, they may be entitled to overtime pay for the additional hours worked, regardless of their late arrival. Employers must comply with the Labor Code, which mandates overtime pay at a rate of at least 25% more than the employee's regular hourly wage for any hours worked beyond eight hours. Both employers and employees should clearly understand these provisions to ensure compliance with labor laws.</p>
