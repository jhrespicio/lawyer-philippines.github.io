<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My partner wants to get a police clearance, but he has a record of gambling during the pandemic. What steps can he take to clear his name?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>If your partner has a police record for gambling during the pandemic, the first step is to check the nature of the case filed, if any, and whether it resulted in a conviction. For minor offenses, such as gambling, the possibility of expungement or clearing the record depends on whether the offense has been resolved or the penalties have been fulfilled. Your partner may also apply for a motion to dismiss the case if it was not elevated to court or if the penalties have been fully served. Consulting with a lawyer to understand the specific circumstances and available legal remedies is essential in this process.</p>
