<p>In the Philippines, labor laws are designed to protect the rights of employees, including regulations on working hours and overtime pay. Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, the standard working hours for an employee are eight hours per day. Any work performed beyond this period qualifies as overtime, which must be compensated with an additional pay rate of at least 25% over the regular hourly wage.</p><p>Employers are obligated to adhere to these regulations to ensure fair treatment of their workers. Overworking employees without proper compensation not only violates the law but can also lead to legal disputes and penalties for the employer. The law also mandates that rest periods, such as weekly rest days and legal holidays, be respected to avoid employee burnout and ensure a healthy work-life balance.</p><p>Employees who believe they are being subjected to excessive work hours without adequate compensation can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The DOLE has the authority to investigate such complaints and enforce compliance with labor laws. It is important for employees to be aware of their rights and for employers to understand their obligations to maintain a fair and lawful working environment.</p>
