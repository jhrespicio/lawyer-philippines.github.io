<p>In the Philippines, the sale of inherited property requires the consent of all legal heirs. Under the Civil Code, co-heirs have equal rights to the inheritance, and no single heir can unilaterally sell the property without the agreement of the others. If an heir attempts to sell the property without the consent of other co-heirs, the sale may be considered voidable. The dissenting heir may file a legal action to annul the sale or seek partition of the property. It is advisable for co-heirs to reach an amicable agreement and consult with a lawyer to ensure the legal sale and proper distribution of proceeds according to the laws on succession.</p>
