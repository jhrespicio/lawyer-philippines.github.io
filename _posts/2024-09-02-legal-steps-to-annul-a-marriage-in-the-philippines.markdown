<p>Annulment is a legal process that declares a marriage null and void, as if it never took place. In the Philippines, the grounds for annulment are strictly defined by law, including reasons such as lack of parental consent, psychological incapacity, fraud, and impotence, among others. The process involves filing a petition before the Regional Trial Court, which includes the submission of necessary documents and evidence. The petitioner must prove the grounds for annulment, and the court may require psychological evaluations or testimonies from witnesses. Once granted, the annulment legally ends the marriage, allowing the parties to remarry. However, it is essential to seek legal advice from a qualified lawyer to navigate the complexities of the annulment process and ensure that all legal requirements are met.</p>
