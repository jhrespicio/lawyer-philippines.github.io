<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>We have an Extrajudicial Settlement (EJS) document for our family's estate from 1999. Since then, two of the signatories—my mother and a sibling—have passed away. Is the EJS still valid, or should we, the surviving heirs, create a new settlement?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>An Extrajudicial Settlement (EJS) remains valid as long as it complies with the laws at the time it was executed. However, since two of the original heirs have passed away, the settlement needs to be updated to reflect the current heirs who will inherit the shares of the deceased. The surviving heirs can execute a new EJS to account for the deaths and redistribute the estate accordingly. This may involve securing the necessary documents, such as death certificates, and consulting with a lawyer to ensure that the settlement complies with all legal requirements. If any minors or incapacitated individuals are involved, further legal steps may be required, such as court approval.</p>
