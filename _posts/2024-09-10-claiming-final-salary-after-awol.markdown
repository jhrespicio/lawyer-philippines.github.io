<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I went AWOL (Absent Without Leave) from my job. Will I still be able to claim my last salary? Iâ€™m not sure if this affects my ability to receive my pay.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Even if you went AWOL, you are still entitled to receive the wages for the work you performed prior to your absence. The employer cannot withhold your last salary without lawful cause. However, your absence without proper notice may subject you to disciplinary action, including dismissal from work. If your employer refuses to release your final salary without a valid reason, you can file a claim with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). It is best to discuss this matter with your employer to clarify any outstanding issues and settle any obligations to prevent further complications.</p>
