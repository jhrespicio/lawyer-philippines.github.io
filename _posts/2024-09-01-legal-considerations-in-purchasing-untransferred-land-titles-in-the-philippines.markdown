<p>In the Philippines, purchasing land where the title has not yet been transferred to the current seller involves several legal considerations. One common scenario is where a prospective buyer intends to acquire a property, such as farmland, but discovers that the title is still in the name of the original owner. The seller may have a Deed of Sale that is not fully compliant with formal requirements, such as when the seller's signature is merely a thumb mark due to their inability to write.</p>

<h2>Legal Framework</h2>
<p>The Philippine legal system mandates that all land transactions comply with specific formalities to ensure their validity and enforceability. Under the Civil Code of the Philippines, a Deed of Sale must be duly notarized to be considered binding between the parties and against third parties. Furthermore, the property title must be registered with the Registry of Deeds to transfer ownership legally.</p>

<p>The Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) and the Property Registration Decree (Presidential Decree No. 1529) govern the transfer of land titles in the Philippines. These laws require that the title be clear and free from any encumbrances before the transfer can be effected. Failure to comply with these legal requirements can lead to disputes and complications, particularly when the title is still in the name of a previous owner.</p>

<h2>Practical Implications</h2>
<p>Purchasing land with an untransferred title poses significant risks. The buyer must ensure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. This includes verifying that the Deed of Sale is duly notarized and that the seller's authority to transfer the property is legitimate. In cases where the seller uses a thumb mark instead of a signature, it is essential to ensure that this is properly witnessed and documented to avoid future legal challenges.</p>

<p>Buyers should also be aware of the importance of immediately registering the transaction with the Registry of Deeds. Failure to register can result in the property remaining legally under the original owner's name, leaving the buyer without legal protection in case of disputes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When purchasing property in the Philippines where the title has not been transferred to the current seller, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence. Buyers must ensure that all legal requirements are met, including the proper execution and notarization of the Deed of Sale and the immediate registration of the title transfer. Consulting with a legal professional is advisable to navigate the complexities of such transactions and to safeguard one's investment.</p>
