<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I have been running an online business since 2021, but I am only registering it now. Will I face any penalties upon registration?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> In the Philippines, late registration of a business may indeed result in penalties. Under the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) regulations, businesses are required to register before the start of operations. Failing to do so may subject you to fines, including a registration fee penalty, a percentage tax for the months of operation without registration, and possibly a compromise penalty depending on the discretion of the BIR. It's advisable to contact the nearest BIR office for guidance and to facilitate proper registration and payment of penalties.</p>
