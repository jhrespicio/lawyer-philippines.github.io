<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>What are the legal consequences if someone enters a house without the owner's permission and injures a young suspect in the process?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Entering a house without the owner's consent constitutes trespassing under Philippine law, which can result in criminal liability. If, in the course of this illegal entry, someone causes injury to another person, such as a young suspect, the trespasser could face additional charges for physical injuries. The severity of the charges depends on the extent of the injury and the circumstances surrounding the incident. The law provides for penalties under the Revised Penal Code, where both trespassing and inflicting injuries carry respective penalties. The individual who suffered harm or the property owner can file complaints, leading to possible criminal prosecution and civil liability for damages.</p>
