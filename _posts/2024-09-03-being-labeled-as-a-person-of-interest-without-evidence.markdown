<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have been labeled as a person of interest regarding 11 missing items from a store. The accusation is based solely on my suspicious behavior seen in CCTV footage. However, the footage does not show me taking any items from the store. What should I do?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Being labeled as a person of interest without concrete evidence can be distressing. In this situation, it is essential to know that under Philippine law, suspicion alone is not enough to justify any legal action against you. The Constitution provides for the presumption of innocence, meaning you are considered innocent until proven guilty. The store management or authorities must have substantial evidence to proceed with any legal action. If they are relying only on CCTV footage that does not clearly show any wrongdoing, you may challenge any accusations in court. Additionally, you may consider filing a complaint for unjust vexation or harassment if the situation escalates without proper evidence.</p>
