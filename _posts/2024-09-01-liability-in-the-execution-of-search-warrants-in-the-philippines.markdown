<p>In the Philippines, search warrants are issued by the court and are executed by law enforcement officers, such as the Philippine National Police (PNP). A search warrant must specifically identify the place to be searched and the items to be seized. The presence of the property owner or occupant during the search is not always required by law, though it is generally advisable. Liability of the owner or occupant, such as in the case of the brother-in-law, depends on several factors. If illegal items are found within the premises, the owner could be held liable if it is proven that they had knowledge or involvement in the illegal activities. However, mere ownership or occupation does not automatically result in liability unless there is evidence linking the individual to the criminal activities. Legal counsel is recommended to assess the specific circumstances of each case.</p>
