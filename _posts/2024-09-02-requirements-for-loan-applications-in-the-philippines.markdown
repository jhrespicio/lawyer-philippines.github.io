<p>In the Philippines, applying for a loan, whether personal or business, often requires certain documents to validate the borrower's identity, financial capacity, and purpose for the loan. One of the key documents that lenders, particularly financial institutions, may ask for is an employment certificate. This certificate serves as proof of employment, income, and the borrowerâ€™s capacity to repay the loan. For those engaged in a restaurant business or other types of self-employment, lenders may require additional documentation, such as business permits, financial statements, or tax returns, to establish credibility and ensure that the business is legitimate and profitable. These requirements help mitigate the risk for lenders by confirming the borrower's stability and reliability.</p>
