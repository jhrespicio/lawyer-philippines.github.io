<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>We have already paid for subdivided lots, but we later discovered that the developer has not obtained the necessary permits. What can we do in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>If the developer has sold subdivided lots without obtaining the required permits, they may be in violation of several laws and regulations. Buyers in such situations have legal recourse, which may include filing a complaint with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) or pursuing legal action for breach of contract. It is crucial to review your contract and consult a lawyer to determine the best course of action. You may also demand a refund or the fulfillment of the agreement, depending on the circumstances. The developer's failure to secure the proper permits could significantly impact the validity of the transaction and your rights as a buyer.</p>
