<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recently discovered that my husband, who is not a Muslim, married a Muslim woman. Is this legal, and what can I do about this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, marriage is governed by the Family Code, which prohibits an individual from marrying another person if they are already married. However, Muslim males, under Presidential Decree No. 1083 (Muslim Personal Laws), may contract multiple marriages as long as they adhere to Islamic law and both parties are Muslims or the husband converts to Islam. If your husband has not converted to Islam and does not fall under the jurisdiction of Muslim personal laws, his second marriage would be considered bigamous, which is illegal under Philippine law. You may file a case for bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code, which could result in imprisonment for the offending party.</p>
