<p>When an individual discovers that a warrant of arrest has been issued against them despite reconciliation with the complainant, it is crucial to address the situation legally and promptly. In the Philippines, once a criminal case has been filed, the process will continue regardless of any personal reconciliations unless the case is formally withdrawn or dismissed by the court. An arrest warrant is issued based on probable cause, and the police are mandated to enforce it.</p><p>If the complainant wishes to withdraw the complaint, they must formally file an affidavit of desistance with the court where the case is pending. This affidavit serves as a declaration that the complainant is no longer interested in pursuing the case. However, it's important to note that the affidavit does not automatically result in the dismissal of the case. The decision to dismiss lies with the judge, who will assess whether the withdrawal is warranted based on the merits of the case and the public interest.</p><p>In cases where an arrest warrant has already been issued, the accused may need to post bail to secure temporary freedom while the case is being resolved. Bail is a constitutional right in most non-capital offenses, ensuring that the accused can continue with their normal activities while the legal process unfolds. The amount of bail is determined by the court and is intended to ensure the presence of the accused at trial.</p><p>It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to navigate the complexities of criminal procedure, particularly in ensuring that the case is handled appropriately and that all necessary legal documents are filed correctly. Failure to address an outstanding warrant can lead to arrest, even if the parties involved have reconciled.</p>
