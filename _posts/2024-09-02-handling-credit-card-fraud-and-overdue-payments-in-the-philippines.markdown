<p>Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the Philippines, and individuals who fall victim to such scams may face challenges, especially when it results in overdue payments. When a credit card is compromised, and fraudulent transactions occur, the cardholder is usually responsible for reporting the fraud to the bank immediately. The bank will then investigate the issue, and if the claim is validated, the fraudulent charges may be reversed.</p><p>However, if the victim of credit card fraud is unable to make payments due to financial constraints, it is crucial to communicate with the credit card company as soon as possible. Many banks offer assistance programs or payment arrangements for individuals facing financial difficulties. It is also important to monitor your credit report and take steps to protect against further fraud, such as changing account passwords and ensuring that personal information is secure.</p><p>Victims of credit card fraud who struggle to pay off their debts due to limited income should explore all available options, including seeking advice from a financial counselor or considering debt consolidation. Additionally, legal recourse may be available if the fraud results in significant financial harm. Consulting with a lawyer can help victims understand their rights and the best course of action to take.</p>
