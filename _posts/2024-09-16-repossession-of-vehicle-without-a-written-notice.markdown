<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I received a phone call that my car is up for repossession because I am two months behind on my payments. However, I havenâ€™t received any written notice about this. I asked if I could pay by the 30th as that is my payday, but the person I spoke to refused. Is this process legal?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, when it comes to the repossession of vehicles, creditors must follow due process. Generally, banks or financing companies are required to give formal notice of default and repossession, typically through written communication. This is often outlined in the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. However, failure to comply with the terms of your contract, such as non-payment for a certain period, can lead to repossession. While some creditors are strict about payment deadlines, you may negotiate for an extension. It is advisable to refer to your contract to understand the repossession process and rights, and seek legal advice to ensure that your rights as a borrower are not being violated.</p>
