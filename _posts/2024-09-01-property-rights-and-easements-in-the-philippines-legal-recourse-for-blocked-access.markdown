<p>In the Philippines, property rights, including the right to access, are protected by law. If a right of way or access route has been historically used by a family or community and is suddenly blocked, the affected parties may have legal grounds to contest the obstruction.</p><p>The Civil Code of the Philippines provides that an easement, such as a right of way, may exist when a property owner needs to access their land through another person’s property. If the right of way is blocked, the aggrieved party can seek legal recourse through the courts to demand that the obstruction be removed.</p><p>Even if the land has been subdivided and the right of way is now part of someone else’s property, the easement may still be enforceable, especially if it is deemed necessary for the ingress and egress of the affected party. The courts will typically consider the necessity of the right of way and any existing agreements or historical use when making a determination.</p><p>To resolve such disputes, it is advisable to seek legal assistance to explore all options, including negotiation, mediation, or litigation. Protecting access rights is vital for maintaining the value and usability of property.</p>
