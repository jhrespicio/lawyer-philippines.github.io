<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>There is an error in my Certificate of No Marriage Record (CENOMAR). Do I need to pay for a correction, and how can I go about fixing this issue?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) handles the issuance and correction of civil registry documents, including the CENOMAR. If there is an error in your CENOMAR, such as a typographical mistake, you will need to file a request for correction with the PSA. A payment for processing is generally required, which covers administrative costs. You may need to present supporting documents, such as birth certificates or identification cards, to validate the correction request. For minor clerical errors, the process is relatively simple and does not require court proceedings. However, if the error involves substantial issues like personal status, a court order may be necessary, which could incur further legal costs.</p>
