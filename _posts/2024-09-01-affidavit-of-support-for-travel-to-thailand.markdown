<h2>Affidavit of Support for Travel to Thailand</h2>
<p>When traveling to Thailand, particularly for tourism or leisure, Philippine authorities and Thai immigration may require proof of financial capacity.  One way to demonstrate this is through an Affidavit of Support, especially if your trip is being financed by your employer.</p>
<h3>What is an Affidavit of Support?</h3>
<p>An Affidavit of Support is a legal document that serves as a written promise by a sponsor, in this case, your company, to provide financial support for your trip to Thailand. It assures authorities that you won't be financially burdened or become reliant on the Thai government during your stay.</p>
<h3>Format and Content</h3>
<p>While there's no strictly prescribed format, an Affidavit of Support for travel to Thailand typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sponsor Information:</strong> Your company's full legal name, address, and contact details.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiary Information:</strong> Your full name, address, passport details, purpose of travel, and intended length of stay in Thailand.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Capacity:</strong>  A statement declaring your company's commitment to covering your travel expenses, including round-trip airfare, accommodation, food, and incidentals.  This can be supported by attaching bank statements or a letter of employment stating your salary and benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Notarization:</strong> The affidavit should be signed by an authorized representative of your company, ideally someone in the HR or finance department, and notarized by a Philippine notary public.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check with the Thai Embassy/Consulate:</strong> It's always best to confirm specific requirements and any additional documents needed with the Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate in the Philippines.</li>
<li><strong>Submit Original Documents:</strong>  Bring the original Affidavit of Support and supporting documents, as photocopies may not be accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Be Prepared for Questions:</strong>  Thai immigration officers may ask questions about your trip, purpose, and finances.  Answer honestly and confidently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>An Affidavit of Support is a crucial document that demonstrates your financial capacity to travel to Thailand when your trip is company-sponsored. By understanding its purpose and ensuring it meets the necessary requirements, you can increase your chances of a smooth and hassle-free entry into Thailand.</p>
