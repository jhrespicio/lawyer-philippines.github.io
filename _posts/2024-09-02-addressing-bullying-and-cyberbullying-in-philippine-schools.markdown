<p>Bullying, including cyberbullying, is a serious concern in schools across the Philippines. The Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 mandates schools to adopt policies to address all forms of bullying, including those conducted online. If a student is being bullied, parents or guardians should first report the matter to the school's Office of Student Affairs (OSA). Schools are required to investigate and act on these reports. However, if the school's response is insufficient, parents can escalate the issue to the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees the implementation of anti-bullying policies. Additionally, parents may seek assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) or the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) for further action. Preparing a comprehensive account of the incidents, including any evidence such as screenshots or witness statements, is crucial when seeking help from these agencies. These steps ensure that the issue is addressed effectively and that the student's rights are protected.</p>
