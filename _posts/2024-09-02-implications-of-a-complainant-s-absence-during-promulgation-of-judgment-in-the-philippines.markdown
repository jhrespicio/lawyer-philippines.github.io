<p>In the Philippine legal system, the promulgation of judgment is a critical phase where the court formally announces its decision on a case. The presence of the complainant during this stage is important but not mandatory. If the complainant is unable to attend the promulgation, the court will still proceed with reading the judgment.</p><p>The complainant, or their legal representative, will be informed of the court's decision after the promulgation. Typically, the court issues a written copy of the judgment to both parties involved in the case. The absence of the complainant does not affect the validity of the judgment, but it is advisable for the complainant to be present to receive the decision firsthand and understand its implications.</p><p>If the complainant fails to attend without a valid reason, it may cause delays in further legal proceedings, such as the execution of judgment or filing of appeals. However, the right to appeal or seek remedies remains available to the complainant regardless of their presence during promulgation. Legal counsel should be consulted to understand the next steps and ensure that the complainant's rights and interests are fully protected in light of the court's decision.</p>
