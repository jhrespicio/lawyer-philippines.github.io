<p>In the Philippines, domestic abuse and financial neglect are serious issues that can have legal consequences. The Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9262) provides protection for spouses and children who are victims of physical, emotional, or economic abuse. This includes instances where a husband may be forcing his wife to return to a hostile environment, physically harming her, or neglecting his financial obligations to the family. Victims of such abuse can file for a protection order, which can include provisions for financial support, temporary custody of children, and prohibition of further contact. In severe cases, criminal charges may be filed against the offending spouse. Victims are encouraged to seek help from legal professionals or support organizations to understand their rights and the legal remedies available to them.</p>
