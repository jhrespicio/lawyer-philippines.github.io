<p>In the Philippines, libel is a criminal offense punishable under the Revised Penal Code. Libelous statements are those that are defamatory and made publicly, whether through traditional media or online platforms like social media. When a statement is made with malice, intending to harm the reputation of another individual, it can be considered libelous. In cases where a person addresses a public figure, such as a Barangay Captain, with derogatory remarks like 'kung may isip ka,' this could be construed as libelous, especially if it damages the reputation of the individual. The person making such statements can be held liable under the law, with penalties that may include imprisonment or fines. It's crucial for individuals to exercise caution when expressing opinions or grievances online, as the ease of communication via platforms like Messenger does not exempt one from the legal consequences of defamatory speech.</p>
