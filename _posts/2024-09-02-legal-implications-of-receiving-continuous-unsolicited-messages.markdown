<p>Receiving continuous unsolicited messages from unknown phone numbers can be considered a violation of privacy and harassment under Philippine law. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) provides protection against unauthorized processing of personal information, which includes the sending of unsolicited messages.
