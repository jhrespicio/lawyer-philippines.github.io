<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I work for a company that initially provided health maintenance organization (HMO) coverage for two dependents as part of the employment contract. However, the company recently downgraded the benefit and now only covers one dependent. Can they legally reduce the HMO coverage despite it being part of my contract?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, benefits provided in the employment contract, such as HMO coverage, are considered part of the agreed terms and conditions of employment. Employers cannot unilaterally downgrade these benefits without the employee's consent, as this would violate the principle of contractual obligations. However, if there is a valid reason for the reduction (such as business exigencies), the company may renegotiate with the employee, but any modification must be mutually agreed upon. If you feel this change was made without due process or proper consultation, you may bring the issue to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for mediation or legal action.</p>
