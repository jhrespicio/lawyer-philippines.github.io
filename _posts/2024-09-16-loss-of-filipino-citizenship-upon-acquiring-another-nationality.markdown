<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was born in Manila and later acquired another country's citizenship. Did I automatically lose my Filipino citizenship when I became a citizen of another country?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, dual citizenship laws are governed by Republic Act No. 9225, or the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003. If you acquired foreign citizenship after this law came into effect, you did not automatically lose your Filipino citizenship. However, to formally retain or re-acquire your Filipino citizenship, you must file a petition with the Bureau of Immigration. This process requires taking an oath of allegiance to the Philippines. Once approved, you will enjoy the rights and privileges of a Filipino citizen while retaining your foreign nationality.</p>
