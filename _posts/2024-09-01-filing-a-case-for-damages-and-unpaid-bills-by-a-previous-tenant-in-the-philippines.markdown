<p>When a previous tenant leaves damages or unpaid utility bills, the landlord may consider filing a legal case to recover the losses. In the Philippines, landlords have the right to seek compensation for damages to the property or unpaid rent and utilities. The process typically involves filing a civil case for damages in the appropriate court, which could be a small claims court depending on the amount involved. It's important to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements, such as the acceptance fee, which can vary based on the court and the amount of the claim. Additionally, if the property owner is residing abroad, the lawyer can fully represent the owner in court, provided that the proper legal documents, such as a Special Power of Attorney, are executed to authorize the lawyer to act on the owner's behalf.</p>
