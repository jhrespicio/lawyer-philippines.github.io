<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My husband and I took over the payments for a condo unit initially purchased by my parents. The developer was supposed to turn over the property in December 2023, but due to delays, it hasnâ€™t happened yet. We've already processed a bank loan and followed all requirements for the transfer of ownership. Our agent failed to inform us of any missing documents until recently, causing further delays. Can we file a complaint with HLURB or PRC against the agent?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you have been experiencing significant delays in the transfer of ownership and the agent has not been transparent about the process, you may have grounds for filing a complaint. In the Philippines, the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), now known as the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD), handles issues related to real estate transactions and condominium purchases. You can file a formal complaint with DHSUD if the developer or agent has failed to meet their obligations as per your contract. If the issue involves potential misconduct or negligence by the agent, you may also file a complaint with the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) if they are a licensed real estate broker. Ensure that you gather all documentation related to the transaction, including correspondence with the agent, contracts, and records of payments. These will serve as evidence when filing your complaint. You may also wish to consult a lawyer specializing in real estate to help assess your case and advise on the best course of action.</p>
