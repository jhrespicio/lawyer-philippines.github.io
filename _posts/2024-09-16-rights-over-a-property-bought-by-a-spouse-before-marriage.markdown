<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recently discovered that my husband purchased a condo in his name before we got married. What rights, if any, do I have over this property now that we are married?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, under the Family Code, properties acquired before marriage generally remain the exclusive property of the spouse who acquired them. This is referred to as the ‘exclusive property’ of the spouse. However, if the property is improved or expenses are made for its preservation or development during the marriage using the conjugal funds or income, the other spouse may have a right to reimbursement for such contributions. Additionally, the nature of the property will depend on the property regime agreed upon during marriage, such as absolute community of property or conjugal partnership of gains.</p>
