<p>Transferring a land title in the Philippines involves several steps and the submission of specific documents to ensure the process is legally binding and recognized by the authorities. The key documents required for the transfer of a land title are:</p><ul><li><strong>Deed of Sale or Deed of Donation:</strong> This is the primary document that transfers ownership from the seller or donor to the buyer or donee. It must be duly signed, notarized, and contain all necessary details about the property and the parties involved.</li><li><strong>Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT):</strong> The original title of the property must be surrendered to the Registry of Deeds along with the deed of sale or donation. The Registry will then cancel the old title and issue a new one in the name of the new owner.</li><li><strong>Tax Clearance:</strong> The property must have no outstanding real property taxes. A tax clearance certificate from the local government unit (LGU) is required to prove this.</li><li><strong>Latest Tax Declaration:</strong> The latest tax declaration from the Assessorâ€™s Office should also be submitted. This document shows the assessed value of the property and is used for tax computation purposes.</li><li><strong>Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) and Transfer Tax Receipts:</strong> Payment of these taxes is essential before the transfer can be processed. Receipts must be presented as proof of payment.</li><li><strong>Notarized Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR):</strong> Issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), this certificate is necessary for the registration of the title transfer.</li></ul><p>Once all documents are complete and submitted to the Registry of Deeds, the new land title will be processed and issued, officially transferring ownership to the new owner.</p>
