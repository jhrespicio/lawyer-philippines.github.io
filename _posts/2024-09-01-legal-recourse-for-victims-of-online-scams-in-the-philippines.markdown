<p>Online scams have become increasingly common in the Philippines, with social media platforms like Twitter being a frequent venue for fraudulent activities. Victims of online scams can seek legal recourse under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175), which criminalizes various forms of online fraud. Victims should immediately report the scam to the appropriate authorities, such as the National Bureau of Investigation&#39;s Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group. Filing a complaint with these agencies can initiate an investigation, which may lead to the identification and prosecution of the perpetrators. In addition to criminal charges, victims may also pursue civil remedies to recover any financial losses incurred due to the scam. However, recovering funds can be challenging, especially if the scammer is based outside the country. Nevertheless, taking prompt legal action and reporting the incident to law enforcement agencies increases the chances of holding the scammers accountable and preventing further victimization.</p>
