<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recently discovered that my husband has been having affairs with other women for a long time. Can this be used as grounds for annulment?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, infidelity is not, by itself, grounds for annulment. Annulment is different from legal separation and is based on specific grounds under the Family Code, such as psychological incapacity, fraud, or lack of consent, among others. However, if the infidelity is a symptom of psychological incapacity, which must be grave, severe, and incurable, it could potentially be argued as such in court. Psychological incapacity refers to the inability of one or both spouses to fulfill the essential marital obligations. It is crucial to consult a lawyer who specializes in family law to evaluate the specifics of your case and determine the best course of action.</p>
