<p>Expropriation is a legal process wherein the government acquires private property for public use, such as infrastructure development, while providing just compensation to the property owner. In the Philippines, expropriation cases can be complex and time-consuming, often depending on various factors, including the property's value, the owner's response, and court schedules. On average, these cases can take several months to a few years to resolve, primarily due to the need for multiple hearings. Hearings in expropriation cases typically occur multiple times throughout the case's lifecycle. Initial hearings often focus on establishing the government's right to expropriate the property, followed by sessions dedicated to determining just compensation. The frequency of hearings can vary depending on the court's docket and the specific issues that arise during the proceedings. Property owners involved in expropriation cases should be prepared for a lengthy process and seek legal assistance to ensure that their rights are adequately protected and that they receive fair compensation for their property.</p>
