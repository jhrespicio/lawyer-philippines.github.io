<p>Usury law in the Philippines is designed to protect borrowers from excessively high interest rates on loans. Historically, the Usury Law set maximum interest rates that lenders could charge, but these rates were gradually lifted over time, allowing for more flexibility in interest rates depending on the agreement between the lender and borrower. However, despite the lifting of these restrictions, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has issued guidelines to ensure that interest rates remain reasonable and do not exploit borrowers. If a lender charges an interest rate that is unconscionably high, the borrower may have grounds to challenge the loan under principles of equity. Courts in the Philippines can void loan agreements with excessively high interest rates or reduce the interest to a more reasonable level. It is advisable for borrowers and lenders alike to be aware of the current legal standards and consult legal professionals if they suspect usurious practices.</p>
