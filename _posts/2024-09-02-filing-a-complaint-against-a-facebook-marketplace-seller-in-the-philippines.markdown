These will serve as evidence in your complaint.</li><li><strong>Contact the Seller:</strong> Attempt to resolve the issue directly with the seller. Sometimes, issues can be resolved amicably without legal intervention.</li><li><strong>Report to Facebook:</strong> Use Facebookâ€™s built-in reporting tools to report the seller.
