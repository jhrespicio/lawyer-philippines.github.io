<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I made a mistake in the form for my DFA appointment. Can I correct the information that I submitted? How can I proceed with this correction?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you need to correct details in your Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) appointment form, the best approach is to contact the DFA through their official communication channels, such as email or their online help desk. You may also visit their office directly or rebook a new appointment. Depending on the type of error, you might be required to provide supporting documents to verify the correction. Ensure that the information is accurate before submitting any forms or booking new appointments to avoid complications.</p>
