<p>Annulment is one of the legal means to terminate a marriage in the Philippines, governed by the Family Code. Unlike divorce, which is not recognized in the country, annulment declares that the marriage was void from the beginning due to specific legal grounds. These grounds are explicitly provided under the Family Code and include lack of parental consent (for marriages of individuals aged 18-21), psychological incapacity, fraud, duress, and incapacity to consummate the marriage, among others.</p><p>For a marriage to be annulled, the aggrieved party must file a petition for annulment in the Family Court. The petitioner must prove the existence of the grounds with sufficient evidence. Psychological incapacity, one of the most common grounds cited, must be proven as a permanent and incurable condition existing at the time of marriage.</p><p>The annulment process is typically lengthy and can be emotionally and financially draining. It involves several stages, including the filing of the petition, pre-trial conferences, trial proper, and the rendering of a decision. The court&#39;s decision can be appealed, and if the annulment is granted, the marriage is declared null and void, as if it never existed. The effects of annulment include the division of conjugal properties and decisions on child custody and support.</p><p>Individuals considering annulment should seek legal advice to understand the complexities of the process and to ensure that they meet the legal requirements for filing a petition.</p>
