What are the initial steps I need to take, and what kind of cases can I file?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Filing a case against a previous employer involves several steps depending on the nature of your claim. Common labor cases include illegal dismissal, non-payment of wages or benefits, and non-issuance of a Certificate of Employment. The first step is to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for conciliation and mediation. If no settlement is reached, the case may proceed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). It is crucial to gather relevant documents such as employment contracts, payslips, and termination letters to support your claim.</p>
