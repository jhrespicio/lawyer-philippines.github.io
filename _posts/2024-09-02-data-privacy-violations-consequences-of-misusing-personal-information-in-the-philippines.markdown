It mandates that organizations, whether public or private, must handle personal data with utmost care and responsibility. A violation occurs when personal information is improperly disclosed, accessed, or misused, particularly when it is sent to the wrong recipient.</p><p>Under the law, personal data is defined as any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as names, addresses, contact details, and even sensitive personal data like financial records and health information. Organizations collecting and processing personal data are required to implement reasonable and appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, accidental disclosure, or any form of data breach.</p><p>If an organization mistakenly sends personal information to the wrong person, it may be held liable for unauthorized processing and disclosure of personal data. The penalties for such violations can be severe, ranging from fines to imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the breach and the sensitivity of the information involved. Affected individuals also have the right to file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC), which oversees the enforcement of the Data Privacy Act.</p><p>The NPC may impose administrative fines and sanctions on organizations found to be in violation of the law. Additionally, the affected individuals may seek damages through civil action for any harm suffered as a result of the data breach. It is essential for organizations to establish strict protocols for handling personal data, including regular training for employees on data privacy best practices, to minimize the risk of such violations.</p>
