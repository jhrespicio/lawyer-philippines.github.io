<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My sister took out a loan from a lending company and unknowingly made me a co-maker. The company is now harassing me with threats to post my pictures on Facebook, accusing me of being a scammer. What legal actions can I take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>As a co-maker, you are generally liable if the primary borrower (your sister) fails to pay the loan. However, the lending company cannot harass or publicly defame you as this constitutes a violation of your rights under the Anti-Cybercrime Law and the Revised Penal Codeâ€™s provisions on libel and unjust vexation. You may file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) or the police for harassment and cyber libel. Additionally, you can consult with a lawyer to explore legal options, such as sending a demand letter to the lending company to cease their unlawful actions.</p>
