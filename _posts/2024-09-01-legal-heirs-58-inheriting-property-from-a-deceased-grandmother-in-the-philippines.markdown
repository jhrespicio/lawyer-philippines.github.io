<p>In the Philippines, the distribution of a deceased person&#39;s estate, including property, is governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines and related laws. When a grandmother passes away, determining the legal heirs who are entitled to inherit the proceeds from the sale of her property involves a clear understanding of the laws on succession.</p><h2>Legal Framework</h2><p>The rules on succession in the Philippines are primarily found in the Civil Code, particularly under Book III, which deals with succession. Succession can be either by will (testate) or by operation of law (intestate). In the absence of a will, intestate succession rules apply.</p><p>Under the Civil Code, the legal heirs in intestate succession are categorized into primary, secondary, and concurring heirs. Primary heirs include legitimate children and descendants, while secondary heirs include legitimate parents and ascendants. Concurring heirs may include the surviving spouse and illegitimate children.</p><p>If a grandmother dies without a will, the estate is divided according to these rules. The legitimate children of the deceased will inherit the estate in equal shares. If any of the children predeceased the grandmother, their legitimate descendants (grandchildren) will inherit by right of representation.</p><h2>Practical Implications</h2><p>In practice, when a grandmother passes away, the first step is to determine whether she left a will. If a will exists, the property is distributed according to her wishes, provided the will complies with the legal requirements. If there is no will, the property is divided among the legal heirs based on intestate succession laws.</p><p>The legal heirs can include the grandmother&#39;s surviving children, grandchildren (if their parents predeceased the grandmother), and possibly the surviving spouse. Illegitimate children are also entitled to inherit, although their share is typically smaller compared to legitimate children.</p><p>When the property is sold, the proceeds are distributed to the legal heirs in proportion to their shares in the estate. It is crucial to settle any estate taxes and obtain the necessary legal documents, such as the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate, to facilitate the distribution of the property&#39;s proceeds.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The process of inheriting property from a deceased grandmother in the Philippines involves a clear understanding of succession laws and the identification of legal heirs. The estate must be settled according to either the will of the deceased or the rules of intestate succession. Legal heirs, including children, grandchildren, and the surviving spouse, are entitled to a share of the proceeds from the sale of the property, following the settlement of any legal obligations such as estate taxes.</p>
