<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I am worried about what could happen if a check I issued bounces. What are the potential consequences?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Issuing a bounced check, also known as a dishonored check, can have serious legal consequences in the Philippines. Under Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, commonly known as the Bouncing Checks Law, issuing a check that is subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds or a closed account is considered a criminal offense. The penalties include imprisonment for up to one year or a fine ranging from the amount of the check up to double its value, but not exceeding Php 200,000. Additionally, the issuer may face civil liabilities, requiring them to settle the amount of the check with the payee. Itâ€™s important to resolve the situation as quickly as possible to avoid legal action.</p>
