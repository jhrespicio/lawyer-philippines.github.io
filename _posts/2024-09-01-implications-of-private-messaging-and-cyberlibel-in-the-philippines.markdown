<p>In the Philippines, the act of sending a private message containing defamatory content can still be considered cyberlibel if it is shared with others, causing harm to the person discussed in the message. Under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, libel committed through a computer system or similar means is punishable by law. The law recognizes that even private communications can have public implications if they are disseminated to a third party, leading to reputational damage. Individuals should be mindful that sharing private messages with defamatory content, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can result in legal consequences for both the original sender and the person who shared the message.</p>
