<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Our family recently completed a survey of the remaining portion of land that has yet to be inherited. Since our father passed away, we have not received any inheritance from this land. Our aunt, however, is now offering the remaining part to us. What steps should we take to ensure that this transfer is legally binding?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Inheritance and property transfers in the Philippines are governed by the Civil Code. First, it is essential to verify the legal ownership of the land and ensure that all heirs are accounted for. The land must undergo a proper partition process, which typically involves legal documentation such as an extrajudicial settlement of estate if no will was left. If all heirs are in agreement, the land can be divided accordingly, and your aunt can transfer her share to you through a deed of donation or sale. To formalize the process, you must register the property with the Registry of Deeds and ensure that all taxes, such as estate and donorâ€™s taxes, are settled.</p>
