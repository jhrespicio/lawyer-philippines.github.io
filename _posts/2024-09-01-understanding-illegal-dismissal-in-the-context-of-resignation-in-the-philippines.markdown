<p>In the Philippines, the concept of illegal dismissal is governed by the Labor Code, which protects employees from being unjustly or arbitrarily terminated by their employers. Illegal dismissal occurs when an employee is terminated without just or authorized cause and without due process.</p><p>When an employee submits a resignation letter, it is considered a voluntary act of ending employment. However, there are circumstances where a resignation could be construed as constructive dismissal if the resignation was forced or coerced by the employer. For instance, if an employer instructs an employee to leave immediately despite the employee having formally filed for resignation, and if this instruction comes before the end of the resignation notice period without any valid reason, it could be seen as tantamount to illegal dismissal.</p><p>According to the law, an employee who resigns is typically required to serve a notice period, usually 30 days, unless waived by the employer. If the employer forces the employee to leave before the expiration of this period without valid cause or due process, it may constitute an illegal dismissal, as the employee is effectively being terminated without the opportunity to complete their notice period or settle their employment properly.</p><p>Employees who believe they have been illegally dismissed can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). If the dismissal is found to be illegal, the employer may be required to reinstate the employee without loss of seniority rights and pay back wages from the time of dismissal until reinstatement. Alternatively, if reinstatement is no longer feasible, the employee may be entitled to separation pay and other benefits.</p><p>Given the complexities of employment law, it is advisable for both employers and employees to seek legal advice to ensure that resignations and terminations are handled in accordance with the law to avoid potential disputes.</p>
