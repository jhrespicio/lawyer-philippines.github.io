<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to understand what is meant by public dominion property in the context of Philippine law. Can you provide clarity on this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Public dominion property refers to assets owned by the State and intended for public use or service. Under the Philippine Civil Code, these include roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges built by the State, as well as seashores, lakes, and navigable or floatable rivers. Such properties cannot be the subject of private ownership and are for the enjoyment and use of the public. The State holds these properties in trust for the people, ensuring they remain accessible and are not alienated for private purposes. Management and maintenance of these properties are usually under the jurisdiction of government agencies to ensure they serve the public interest.</p>
