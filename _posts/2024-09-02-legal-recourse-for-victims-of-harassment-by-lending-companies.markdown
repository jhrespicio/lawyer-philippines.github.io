<p>Text and call harassment from lending companies or their agents is a growing concern in the Philippines, particularly as many consumers fall behind on debt payments. The Financial Consumer Protection Act (RA 11765) and various Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) regulations provide consumers with protection against abusive collection practices. Under these laws, lenders and their agents are prohibited from using threatening, intimidating, or harassing methods to collect debts.</p><p>Consumers experiencing such harassment can file a complaint with the BSP or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), depending on the type of lender involved. Additionally, victims may consider pursuing civil action for damages under the Civil Code or file a criminal complaint for unjust vexation or grave threats if the harassment is severe. It is important for consumers to document all instances of harassment to support their case effectively.</p>
