<p>In the Philippines, land ownership is a significant asset, and ensuring that the ownership documents are in proper order is crucial. When a property is still under a tax declaration, it is not yet considered a fully titled property. This situation often arises with inherited lands, particularly when the original owner passes away, leaving the heirs to manage the property. To transfer ownership and secure a land title, the following steps should be taken:</p><ul><li><strong>Secure the Heirs’ Agreement:</strong> If the property is inherited, the heirs must first agree on how to divide the property. If there is no will, this process usually involves an extrajudicial settlement among the heirs.</li><li><strong>Pay Estate Taxes:</strong> The heirs must pay the estate taxes due. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) will issue a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) after payment, which is necessary for transferring the title.</li><li><strong>File for a Land Title:</strong> With the CAR, heirs can proceed to the Register of Deeds to apply for a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) in their names.</li><li><strong>Survey and Other Requirements:</strong> In some cases, a land survey may be required, especially if the property’s boundaries are unclear. Additional documents such as the death certificate of the deceased owner and the tax declaration will also be needed.</li><li><strong>Update the Tax Declaration:</strong> Once the title is transferred, the heirs must update the tax declaration in the local assessor’s office to reflect the new ownership.</li></ul><p>This process can be complex, and it may be beneficial to seek legal assistance to ensure that all steps are correctly followed.</p>
