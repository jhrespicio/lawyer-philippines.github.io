<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I resigned from my job, but my final pay was deducted to pay off a loan at a bank. However, the loan remains active according to the bank's records. What should I do in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In cases like this, where your final pay was deducted to cover a loan but the bank shows the loan as still active, you should first request documentation from both your employer and the bank. This documentation should include proof of payment made by your employer and a detailed account statement from the bank. If the employer confirms the payment but the bank does not reflect it, you may formally dispute the transaction with the bank through a written letter, including the employer's proof of payment. If the issue persists, you may file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or seek legal advice to explore possible litigation to resolve the discrepancy.</p>
