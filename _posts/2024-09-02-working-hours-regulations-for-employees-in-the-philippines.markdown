<p>In the Philippines, the standard working hours for employees are set by the Labor Code. According to the law, the normal hours of work for an employee shall not exceed eight hours a day. Any work performed beyond this period is considered overtime and must be compensated with an additional pay rate. The Labor Code also mandates that employees be given a 60-minute meal break during their workday, which is not included in the calculation of the eight-hour work period.</p><p>There are specific rules for certain types of employees, such as those in healthcare, retail, and agricultural sectors, where variations to the standard work hours may apply. Additionally, companies are required to observe rest days, typically at least one day off for every six consecutive days of work. If an employee is required to work on their rest day, they are entitled to additional compensation. Employees are also entitled to night shift differential pay if they work between 10 PM and 6 AM.</p>
