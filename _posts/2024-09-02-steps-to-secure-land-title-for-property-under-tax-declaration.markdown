<p>In the Philippines, land ownership is often evidenced by a land title, but there are instances where a property is still under a tax declaration, especially in cases of inherited properties. For heirs who wish to secure a formal title for such properties, there are specific steps that need to be followed.</p><p>First, the heirs must ensure that the estate of the deceased parent has been settled. This can be done through an extrajudicial settlement if the heirs are in agreement, or through judicial settlement if there are disputes. The settlement of the estate will include the determination of the heirs and the partition of the properties, which is crucial for transferring ownership.</p><p>After settling the estate, the heirs should proceed with the payment of the estate tax to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). The BIR will issue a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) upon payment of the tax, which is necessary for transferring the property title to the heirs.</p><p>Next, the heirs must secure the necessary documents to convert the tax declaration into a title. These documents typically include the CAR, a deed of extrajudicial settlement, the death certificate of the deceased, and the tax declaration. The heirs must submit these documents to the Registry of Deeds where the property is located.</p><p>The Registry of Deeds will then process the application and issue a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) in the names of the heirs. It is important to note that additional requirements may vary depending on the local government unit (LGU) and the specific circumstances of the property.</p><p>Securing a land title is a crucial step in formalizing ownership and protecting property rights. Heirs are encouraged to complete this process as soon as possible to avoid potential legal complications in the future.</p>
