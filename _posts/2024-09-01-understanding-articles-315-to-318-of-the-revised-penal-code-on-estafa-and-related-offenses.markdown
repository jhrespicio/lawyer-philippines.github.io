<p>Articles 315 to 318 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines cover crimes related to fraud, deceit, and other forms of swindling. Article 315 specifically addresses the crime of estafa, which involves defrauding another person by means of false pretenses or deceit. The penalties for estafa vary depending on the amount defrauded and the manner in which the crime was committed. Article 316 involves fraud committed by a trustee or liquidator, while Article 317 deals with fraudulent insolvency. Article 318, on the other hand, penalizes other deceits not covered by the previous articles. These offenses are considered serious and carry significant penalties, including imprisonment. If someone is accused of violating these articles, it is crucial to seek legal advice to understand the specific charges and potential defenses.</p>
