<p>Retrenchment is a cost-cutting measure employed by companies facing financial difficulties, and it is governed by specific provisions under Philippine labor law. Employers must follow due process, which includes notifying the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and providing affected employees with adequate notice and severance pay. If employees feel that the retrenchment process was not carried out lawfully, they may file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC provides a venue for mediation and arbitration of labor disputes. If a case is not resolved in mediation, it may proceed to arbitration, where a labor arbiter will make a decision. It is important for employees to be aware of their rights, such as the right to receive summons and attend hearings, as these are critical in ensuring fair treatment in labor disputes.</p>
