<p>The naming convention for illegitimate children in the Philippines has specific legal implications. Under Philippine law, an illegitimate child is generally allowed to use the surname of the mother. The use of a middle name for illegitimate children has been a subject of legal debate, especially when the father acknowledges paternity. In cases where an affidavit of acknowledgment of paternity is attached to the birth certificate, the child may use the father's surname as their middle name. However, this is not automatic, and certain legal processes may be required, particularly if the father is deceased or if there are disputes over paternity. The child's right to use a middle name, especially in situations where the parents are not married, reflects the evolving legal landscape concerning the rights of illegitimate children. It is advisable to consult legal professionals to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and to address any issues regarding the naming of the child on their birth certificate.</p>
