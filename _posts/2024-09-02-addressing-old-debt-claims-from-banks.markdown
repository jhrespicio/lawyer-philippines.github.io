<p>Debt claims from banks, even those dating back several decades, can still be pursued if the debt remains unpaid. However, the enforcement of such claims is subject to the statute of limitations, which, under Philippine law, generally ranges from five to ten years depending on the type of contract involved. If a bank attempts to collect on a very old debt, it is essential to verify whether the claim is still legally enforceable. Additionally, the debtor should request proof of the debt and the history of payments or lack thereof. If the debtor believes the claim is erroneous or the statute of limitations has passed, they can challenge the demand in court or through legal counsel. It is crucial to respond promptly to such claims to avoid further legal complications.</p>
