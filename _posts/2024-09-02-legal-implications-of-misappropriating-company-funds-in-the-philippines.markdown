<p>Misappropriating company funds is a serious offense under Philippine law. This act, where an employee uses company money for personal gain, even if the intent is to return it later, can lead to criminal charges. Under the Revised Penal Code, such an act can be classified as qualified theft or estafa, depending on the circumstances. Qualified theft is punishable by imprisonment, especially if the employee had access to the funds due to their job position. Estafa, on the other hand, involves deceit and abuse of confidence and carries penalties depending on the amount involved. The fact that the funds were returned may mitigate the penalty, but it does not absolve the person from criminal liability. In cases where the full amount is not returned, as in the scenario described, the individual faces increased legal risks, including potential civil liability to recover the remaining amount. Employees should understand the gravity of such actions and seek legal advice if they find themselves in such situations.</p>
