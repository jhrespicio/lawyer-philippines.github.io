<p>In the Philippines, the concept of conjugal property applies to married couples, where assets acquired during the marriage are generally considered jointly owned. However, for live-in partners who are not legally married, the rules regarding property ownership are different and require careful consideration.</p><p><strong>1. Legal Recognition of Live-In Relationships:</strong> The Family Code of the Philippines does not automatically recognize live-in relationships as a basis for establishing conjugal property. Unlike married couples, live-in partners do not benefit from the presumption that properties acquired during the relationship are jointly owned.</p><p><strong>2. Property Acquisition:</strong> For live-in partners, any property acquired by either partner during the relationship remains individually owned unless there is clear evidence of joint ownership. This evidence could be in the form of co-ownership agreements, receipts, or other documentation proving both partners contributed to the acquisition of the property.</p><p><strong>3. Duration of Cohabitation:</strong> Unlike marriage, there is no specific legal period of cohabitation that converts individually owned properties into conjugal properties for live-in partners. Each partner retains ownership of properties registered in their name unless they can prove a different agreement.</p><p><strong>4. Importance of Legal Documentation:</strong> To protect their interests, live-in partners may enter into contracts or agreements that clearly define the ownership and division of properties. These agreements can help prevent disputes in the event of a separation.</p><p>It is important to seek legal advice when navigating property issues in live-in relationships, as the lack of legal marriage can complicate the distribution of assets.</p>
