<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I want to ask if there are fees involved every time we meet with a lawyer for consultations. Are consultation fees a standard practice?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Yes, lawyers in the Philippines generally charge consultation fees for their time and legal advice. The amount varies depending on the lawyer's expertise, the complexity of the legal issue, and the firm they work for. It is important to clarify the fee arrangement upfront to avoid misunderstandings. Some lawyers may offer an initial consultation for free or at a discounted rate, but subsequent meetings are typically billed either hourly or per session.</p><p>Itâ€™s advisable to discuss and agree upon the consultation fees before proceeding with any legal consultations.</p>
