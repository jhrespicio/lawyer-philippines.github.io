<p>Under Philippine labor laws, employers are required to provide their employees with proper training and notice before assigning new tasks that fall outside their regular duties. This requirement is based on the principle that employees must be adequately prepared and informed to perform their work safely and efficiently. Failure to provide proper training can lead to workplace accidents, decreased productivity, and potential legal liabilities for the employer.</p><p>Employers must issue a clear and detailed notice when assigning new tasks, explaining the scope, responsibilities, and expectations. This notice should also include information on any training that will be provided to ensure the employee can perform the task competently. If an employee feels they have been assigned a task without proper training or notice, they may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</p><p>It is advisable for employers to document all training sessions and notices provided to employees to protect themselves from potential disputes. Proper documentation can serve as evidence that the employer has fulfilled their legal obligations in ensuring a safe and well-prepared workforce.</p>
