<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If I issue a check to settle a debt, including the interest payments, are there specific considerations or precautions I should be aware of?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Issuing a check to pay off a debt, including interest, is a common method of settling financial obligations. When issuing such a check, ensure that the amount covers both the principal debt and the agreed-upon interest. It is also important to note that under Philippine law, the issuance of a bouncing check, i.e., one that cannot be honored due to insufficient funds, is a criminal offense under the Batas Pambansa Blg. 22. Therefore, you must ensure that there are sufficient funds in your account when the check is presented for payment. Itâ€™s also advisable to get a written acknowledgment from the creditor stating that the payment has been received in full satisfaction of the debt, including interest, to avoid any future disputes.</p>
