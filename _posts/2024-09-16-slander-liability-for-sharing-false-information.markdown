<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If I unknowingly shared false information but I wasn’t the one who initially spread the rumor, can I still be held liable for slander?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, slander, also known as oral defamation, is punishable under the Revised Penal Code. To be liable for slander, there must be a willful and malicious imputation of a crime, vice, or defect. If you simply repeated a false statement without malice or intent to harm, you might not be held criminally liable for slander. However, if it can be proven that you knowingly shared false information with the intent to damage someone’s reputation, you may be held responsible. The context and intent behind the dissemination of the information will be crucial in determining liability.</p>
