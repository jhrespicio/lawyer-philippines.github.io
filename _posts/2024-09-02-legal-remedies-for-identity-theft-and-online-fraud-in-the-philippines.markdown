<p>Identity theft and online fraud are serious offenses in the Philippines, punishable under various laws, including the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) and the Revised Penal Code. If someone uses another personâ€™s identity, such as creating a fake social media account to commit fraud or obtain loans, the victim has legal recourse. The offender may be charged with cyber libel, identity theft, and estafa (fraud). Victims should report the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group. Gathering evidence, such as screenshots, messages, and any fraudulent transactions, is crucial for building a case. The penalties for identity theft and online fraud can include imprisonment and fines. Victims may also file civil actions for damages against the perpetrator to recover any financial losses incurred due to the fraudulent activities.</p>
