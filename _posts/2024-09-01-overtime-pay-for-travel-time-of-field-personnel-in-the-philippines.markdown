<p>In the Philippines, the issue of whether travel time for field personnel, such as engineers, qualifies for overtime pay is a nuanced one. Under Philippine labor laws, specifically the Labor Code, overtime pay is granted for work performed beyond the regular eight-hour workday. However, travel time is generally not considered working time unless the employee is performing their job duties during this period or the travel is done during normal working hours.</p><p>For field personnel, travel time could be considered compensable working time if the travel is necessary for the performance of their duties and occurs within their regular working hours. If the travel time exceeds eight hours and is necessary for the job, it may be subject to overtime pay. Additionally, employers and employees can enter into agreements that specify conditions under which travel time is considered working time. It is advisable for employees to consult their employment contracts or company policies to clarify these terms. Ultimately, the classification of travel time as overtime depends on the specific circumstances and agreements between the employer and the employee.</p>
