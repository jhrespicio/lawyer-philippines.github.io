<p>Defamation is a criminal offense in the Philippines, and it occurs when someone makes a false statement that damages another person's reputation. In the context of social media and carpooling groups, posting false and harmful statements about someone can be grounds for a defamation lawsuit. The Revised Penal Code defines defamation, or libel, as a public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, that tends to cause dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a person. Victims of online defamation can file a complaint with the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) or seek civil remedies, including damages for the harm caused to their reputation.</p>
