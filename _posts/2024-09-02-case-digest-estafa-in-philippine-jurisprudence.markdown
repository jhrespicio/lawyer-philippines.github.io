<p><strong>Case Title:</strong> People of the Philippines vs. Florante D. Chavez<br><strong>G.R. No.:</strong> 124739<br><strong>Decided:</strong> October 1, 2003<br><strong>Facts:</strong> Florante D. Chavez was accused of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code. Chavez, acting as a financial adviser, convinced the complainant to invest a significant sum of money in a purported business venture. Chavez promised that the investment would yield high returns. However, after receiving the money, Chavez failed to deliver the returns and refused to return the investment. It was later discovered that the business venture was non-existent, and Chavez had no intention of fulfilling his promises.</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> Whether or not Florante D. Chavez is guilty of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code.</p><p><strong>Ruling of the Court:</strong> The Supreme Court found Florante D. Chavez guilty of estafa. The Court ruled that Chavez employed deceit to induce the complainant into parting with her money by falsely representing that he would invest it in a profitable business venture. The essential elements of estafa—deceit and damage—were clearly established. The Court held that the act of making false pretenses or fraudulent representations as to the existence of a business venture constituted deceit. The resulting damage to the complainant, who lost a significant sum of money, fulfilled the second element of the crime.</p><p><strong>Decision:</strong> Florante D. Chavez was sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment, as provided by law, and was ordered to indemnify the complainant for the full amount invested, plus legal interest. The decision emphasized the importance of protecting individuals from fraudulent schemes and ensuring that justice is served in cases of financial deception.</p>
