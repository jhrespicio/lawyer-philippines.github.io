<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I took out a loan, and the lender is harassing me via text messages, threatening to post my personal information on social media. My loan is due tomorrow, and I feel uncomfortable with their tactics. How do I file a case for harassment?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine law, creditors are not allowed to harass or publicly shame borrowers to collect debt. The behavior you described could fall under the crime of unjust vexation or other related laws protecting individuals from harassment. You can file a complaint at your local barangay or directly with the police station. Additionally, you may report such behavior to the National Privacy Commission (NPC) if your private data is being threatened with exposure. It is advisable to keep all evidence, such as text messages, for when you file a formal complaint.</p>
