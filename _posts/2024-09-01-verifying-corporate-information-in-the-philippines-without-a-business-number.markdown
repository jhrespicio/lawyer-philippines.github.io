<p>In the Philippines, individuals or entities seeking to verify corporate information can do so through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains a publicly accessible database where users can search for information about registered corporations using the company name, even if the business number is not available. This database provides details such as the company's registration number, date of incorporation, status, and other relevant corporate details. Additionally, for more comprehensive information, one can request a Certificate of Good Standing or other specific documents from the SEC. This process may involve a nominal fee and require a formal request or application. Ensuring that a company is duly registered and in good standing is an essential step for anyone looking to engage in business transactions or verify the legitimacy of a corporate entity in the Philippines.</p>
