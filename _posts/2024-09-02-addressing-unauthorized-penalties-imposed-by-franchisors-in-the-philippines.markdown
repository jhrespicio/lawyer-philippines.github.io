<p>In the franchising business in the Philippines, the relationship between the franchisor and franchisee is governed by the franchise agreement. This contract outlines the rights and obligations of both parties, including any penalties that may be imposed for violations of the agreement's terms.</p><p>If a franchisor imposes a penalty that is not stipulated in the franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to challenge this action. Any penalty or fee that is not clearly outlined in the agreement may be considered unauthorized and potentially unenforceable.</p><p>To address such a situation, the franchisee should first review the franchise agreement carefully to confirm whether the penalty in question is mentioned. If it is not, the franchisee should communicate with the franchisor in writing, requesting clarification and citing the specific terms of the agreement that are relevant.</p><p>If the franchisor insists on imposing the unauthorized penalty, the franchisee may seek legal recourse. This can involve filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory body, such as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), or pursuing legal action in court to challenge the validity of the penalty.</p><p>Franchisees should also be aware of their rights under the Philippine Civil Code, which protects parties from unfair or abusive practices in contractual relationships. In some cases, franchisors who impose unauthorized penalties may be found to have violated these protections.</p><p>Seeking advice from a lawyer who specializes in franchising and commercial law is advisable to ensure that your rights as a franchisee are upheld and that any disputes with the franchisor are resolved in a fair and legal manner.</p>
