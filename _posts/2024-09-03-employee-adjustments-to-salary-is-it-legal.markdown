<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Is it correct for employees to be the ones adjusting their salaries? This situation has arisen at our workplace, and we are unsure if this practice is legal.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine labor laws, salary adjustments should be managed by the employer, not the employees. The employer has the responsibility to ensure that wages comply with the minimum wage laws and other statutory requirements. Employees may negotiate their salaries during hiring or performance evaluations, but the final decision and implementation of any salary adjustment rest with the employer. If employees are being asked to adjust their own salaries, this may indicate improper or illegal practices, and it is advisable to consult with a labor lawyer or report the matter to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for further investigation.</p>
