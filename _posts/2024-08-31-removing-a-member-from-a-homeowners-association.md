**Can a Homeowners' Association in the Philippines Remove a Member Who Has Not Paid Dues or Attended Meetings?**

In the Philippines, the operation and governance of homeowners' associations (HOAs) are primarily regulated by Republic Act No. 9904, also known as the "Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations." This law outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the association and its members.

**Non-Payment of Dues**

One of the primary obligations of a member of a homeowners' association is the payment of dues and other assessments as determined by the association's board. These dues are essential for the maintenance and upkeep of the community, as well as for the funding of various projects and activities. If a member fails to pay these dues, the association has the right to take appropriate actions to recover the amount owed. 

Under RA 9904, the association may impose penalties, interest, or other charges for late payments. Additionally, the association has the legal right to file a civil case for the collection of unpaid dues. However, the law does not specifically provide for the outright removal of a member from the association solely due to non-payment of dues.

**Non-Attendance at Meetings**

Attendance at meetings is another responsibility of HOA members. Regular meetings are crucial for decision-making and for ensuring that the association functions effectively. While repeated non-attendance can be seen as a neglect of duties, RA 9904 does not explicitly grant the association the authority to remove a member based solely on their failure to attend meetings.

**Grounds for Removal**

The removal of a member from a homeowners' association is a serious matter and must be based on legitimate grounds. According to RA 9904, a member may be removed for causes such as violations of the associationâ€™s bylaws, engaging in activities that are detrimental to the community, or other acts that are expressly stated as grounds for removal in the association's governing documents.

**Procedure for Removal**

If the association's bylaws provide for the removal of a member, the process must be carried out in accordance with those bylaws and in compliance with due process. This typically involves providing the member with notice of the proposed removal, an opportunity to respond to the allegations, and a fair hearing before the board or the general assembly. Any decision to remove a member must be made in good faith and must not be arbitrary or capricious.

**Conclusion**

In summary, while non-payment of dues and non-attendance at meetings are serious issues, they do not automatically warrant the removal of a member from a homeowners' association. The association must follow the procedures outlined in its bylaws and ensure that any action taken is in compliance with RA 9904 and the principles of due process.
