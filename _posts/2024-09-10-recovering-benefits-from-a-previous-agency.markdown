<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to inquire about what benefits an employee can still recover from their previous agency after resigning. Are there any entitlements that can still be claimed even after leaving the agency?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, an employee may be entitled to certain benefits even after resigning from an agency. These may include any unpaid wages, unused leave credits, and 13th-month pay for the period worked within the calendar year. If the employee was under contract and it includes specific post-employment benefits, these should also be honored. The employee should also receive a certificate of employment upon request. If the agency does not comply, the employee can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</p>
