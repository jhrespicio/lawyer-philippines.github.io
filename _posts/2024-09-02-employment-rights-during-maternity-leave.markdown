<p>Maternity leave is a fundamental right for female employees in the Philippines, as provided under Republic Act No. 11210, also known as the Expanded Maternity Leave Law. This law grants 105 days of paid maternity leave to female workers, with an additional 15 days for solo mothers. The law also protects employees from being terminated during this period, ensuring that they can return to their jobs after their leave.</p><p>Termination of employment during maternity leave is generally prohibited unless there is a valid reason for dismissal that is not related to the employee's pregnancy or maternity leave status. Grounds such as serious misconduct, gross negligence, or other just causes outlined in the Labor Code may be considered valid reasons, but the employer must provide substantial evidence and follow due process.</p><p>If an employee is terminated during maternity leave without valid cause, it may be considered illegal dismissal. The affected employee has the right to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). Remedies may include reinstatement, payment of back wages, and other forms of compensation.</p><p>It is crucial for both employers and employees to be aware of their rights and obligations under the law. Employers should ensure that they comply with the legal requirements, while employees should understand the protections afforded to them during maternity leave.</p>
