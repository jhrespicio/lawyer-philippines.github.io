<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have an ongoing case in Branch 34 QC, and my lawyer won't be available on the scheduled hearing date. What should I do in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>When your lawyer is unavailable for a scheduled court hearing, you must immediately notify the court. You may request a postponement by filing a motion for the postponement of the hearing, citing the unavailability of your counsel as the reason. Courts usually grant this request if the lawyerâ€™s absence is justified and the motion is filed within a reasonable time. However, it is crucial that this motion is properly filed before the scheduled hearing date. Additionally, you may seek to engage substitute counsel if postponement is not feasible or if your lawyer will be unavailable for an extended period.</p>
