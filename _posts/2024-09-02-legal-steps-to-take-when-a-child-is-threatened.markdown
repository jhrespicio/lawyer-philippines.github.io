<p>When a child is threatened by another person, it is crucial to take immediate legal action to ensure their safety. In the Philippines, threats against a child can be addressed through various legal channels. The first step is to report the threat to the local authorities, such as the barangay or the police, to ensure that there is an official record of the incident. Depending on the severity of the threat, a restraining order or a protection order may be sought from the court to prevent the perpetrator from approaching the child. Additionally, the incident can be reported to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), which can provide further assistance and protection for the child. It is also advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in family law to explore other legal options, such as filing a criminal complaint for grave threats or child abuse, depending on the circumstances.</p>
