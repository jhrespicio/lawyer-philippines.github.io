<p>A Special Power of Attorney (SPA) is a legal document that grants a person, known as the agent or attorney-in-fact, the authority to act on behalf of another person, known as the principal, in specific matters. In the context of handling permits and transactions with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the Philippines, an SPA is often required when the principal cannot personally attend to these tasks.</p><p>To create an SPA, the document must clearly specify the acts that the agent is authorized to perform, such as filing documents, signing applications, and obtaining necessary permits from government agencies. The SPA must be signed by the principal and notarized to be legally binding. Notarization ensures the authenticity of the document and the identity of the signatories.</p><p>When drafting the SPA, it is important to include details such as the full name and address of both the principal and the agent, a clear description of the authority granted, and any limitations on the agent's powers. The SPA should also indicate the duration of its validity, which may be for a specific period or until the completion of the assigned tasks.</p><p>Once notarized, the agent can present the SPA to the relevant government offices, such as the BIR, along with any other required documents to process the transactions on behalf of the principal. It is advisable to seek legal assistance in drafting the SPA to ensure that it fully complies with the legal requirements and adequately protects the interests of the principal.</p>
