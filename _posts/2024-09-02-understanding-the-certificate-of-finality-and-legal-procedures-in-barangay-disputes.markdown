<p>In the Philippines, disputes between parties often go through the barangay justice system before escalating to formal court proceedings. A critical part of this process is the issuance of a Certificate of Finality, which signifies the resolution of a dispute.</p><p>When a settlement is reached through mediation at the barangay level, both parties are expected to comply with the terms agreed upon. The Lupon Tagapamayapa, or the Peace Council, facilitates these hearings and issues a Certificate of Finality when a decision is finalized and no appeal is filed within the prescribed period.</p><p>However, if one party fails to attend scheduled hearings, the Lupon may still proceed with the decision-making process. In some cases, emergency situations might justify a partyâ€™s absence, but these reasons must be promptly communicated to the Lupon.</p><p>Non-compliance or failure to attend hearings can result in the forfeiture of certain rights, such as the right to challenge the decision or the right to receive a Certificate of Finality. If a party does not receive the certificate due to attendance lapses, they may face difficulties in enforcing their claims, as the certificate serves as proof that the case has been resolved and can no longer be contested.</p><p>Parties who believe they were unjustly deprived of their rights due to valid reasons for non-attendance can appeal the decision, but this must be done within a specific timeframe, and valid documentation of the reasons must be provided.</p>
