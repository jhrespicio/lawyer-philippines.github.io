<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Can I file a case against a Muslim woman who married my husband, knowing full well that my husband already has a family?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, bigamy is a crime under the Revised Penal Code, which means that a person who contracts a second marriage while the first is still valid can be prosecuted. However, under Muslim Personal Law (Presidential Decree No. 1083), a Muslim man is allowed to have multiple wives, provided that he can treat them equally and justly. If your husband is Muslim, this might be allowed, but only under specific conditions. Nevertheless, if your husband is not Muslim, then his marriage to another woman, regardless of the latterâ€™s religion, can be considered bigamous and illegal. You may file a case of bigamy against your husband. Additionally, you can consult a lawyer for legal advice on your rights and options in this situation.</p>
