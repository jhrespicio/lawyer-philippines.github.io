<p>In the Philippines, the rights of illegitimate children are protected under the Family Code and other relevant laws. While legitimate children enjoy full rights, illegitimate children also have specific entitlements. One of the primary rights of an illegitimate child is the right to support from their parents. This means that the child is entitled to financial support necessary for their sustenance, education, and other essential needs.</p><p>Another significant right is the child's right to inherit from their parents. While the inheritance share of an illegitimate child is typically less than that of a legitimate child, they are still entitled to a portion of the parent's estate. It is important to note that the law allows an illegitimate child to inherit from their biological parents, but they are not entitled to inherit from the legitimate relatives of their parents.</p><p>Additionally, an illegitimate child has the right to use the surname of their father, provided that the father acknowledges the child. This can be done either voluntarily by the father or through a court order, which may be necessary if the father initially denies paternity. Furthermore, the illegitimate child is entitled to be part of the family of the parent who acknowledges them, including the right to establish relationships with other family members.</p><p>While illegitimate children have these rights, it is essential to note that they do not enjoy all the privileges granted to legitimate children, particularly in terms of inheritance and the use of the father's surname. Legal processes, such as court recognition, may be required to assert these rights, and it is advisable to consult with a legal expert to navigate these complexities.</p>
