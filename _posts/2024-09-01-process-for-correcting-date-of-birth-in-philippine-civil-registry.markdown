<p>The correction of errors in civil registry records, including the date of birth, is governed by Republic Act No. 9048, as amended by Republic Act No. 10172. This law authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct clerical or typographical errors in civil registry entries, including changes in the date of birth.</p><p>To initiate the correction process, the interested party must file a petition for correction with the local civil registry office where the birth was registered. Since the parents of the petitioner are deceased, the petitioner must provide additional supporting documents, such as a birth certificate issued by the hospital or a baptismal certificate, to establish the correct date of birth. The petition must be accompanied by valid identification and other relevant documents that support the claim.</p><p>The petition will be reviewed by the civil registrar, who may require a hearing if necessary. If the petition is granted, the civil registrar will make the necessary corrections to the civil registry records. It is important to note that corrections under RA 9048, as amended, do not involve changing substantial matters like the nationality, age, or legitimacy of the person.</p><p>If the correction is denied, the petitioner may appeal the decision to the proper court for further consideration. Legal representation is recommended throughout this process to ensure compliance with all procedural requirements and to address any complications that may arise.</p><p>Correcting an error in the date of birth is a vital legal process that ensures the accuracy of official records. This correction can have significant implications for various legal matters, including identity verification, inheritance, and other civil rights.</p>
