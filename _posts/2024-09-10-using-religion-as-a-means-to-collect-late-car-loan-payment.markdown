<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Is it legally permissible to use religious beliefs or affiliations as a basis to collect late payments for a car loan? I would like to know if invoking religious grounds would be acceptable in a legal sense.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, debt collection is governed by law and must adhere to legal processes. Religion cannot be used as a legal basis or justification for collecting debts. Debt collection should focus on the terms of the contract signed by both parties. If a debtor is in default, the lender may take legal action, such as filing a case for collection or initiating a demand letter, based on the signed agreement. Utilizing religious beliefs or affiliations as leverage in a debt collection process would not be recognized by courts, and it may even be considered unethical or coercive. The focus should remain on the legal contract and the terms outlined in the loan agreement.</p>
