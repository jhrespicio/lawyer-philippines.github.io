<p>In the Philippines, the rights of illegitimate children are protected under the Family Code and various other laws. Illegitimate children, although born outside of a valid marriage, are entitled to certain rights, particularly in terms of inheritance and financial support from their biological parents.</p><p>One of the key rights of an illegitimate child is the right to inherit from their biological parents. Under Philippine law, illegitimate children are entitled to half of the inheritance that legitimate children would receive. This means that if a parent passes away, an illegitimate child has the legal right to claim their share of the parent's estate, subject to the rules of succession.</p><p>In terms of financial support, the law mandates that parents provide for the needs of their illegitimate children. This obligation includes providing for the child's education, healthcare, and other basic necessities. The financial support must be commensurate with the parent's income and the child's needs.</p><p>In cases where the legitimate spouse or other heirs refuse to give the illegitimate child their rightful share of the inheritance, the child or their legal guardian may file a case in court to enforce their rights. It is advisable to seek the assistance of a lawyer who specializes in family law to navigate the legal process and ensure that the illegitimate child's rights are upheld.</p><p>Furthermore, the legal recognition of an illegitimate child is crucial for the child to claim their rights. This recognition can be established through various means, such as voluntary acknowledgment by the parent or through a court order.</p><p>Overall, while illegitimate children face certain limitations compared to legitimate children, Philippine law provides them with substantial protection, particularly in matters of inheritance and financial support.</p>
