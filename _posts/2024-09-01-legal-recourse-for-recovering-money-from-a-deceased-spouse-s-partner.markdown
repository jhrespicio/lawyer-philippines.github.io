<p>In the unfortunate event of a spouse's death, complications may arise when dealing with financial matters involving third parties, such as a mistress or partner who participated in financial transactions. Under Philippine law, you may have a right to claim any money that was jointly owned or owed to the deceased. If a third party, such as the mistress, has taken control of assets or owes you money as part of the deceased's estate, you can initiate legal action to recover those funds. This may involve filing a civil case to claim your share of the property or money in question. The key is to gather evidence proving the deceased’s financial contribution and your legal right to the claim. Consulting with a lawyer is advisable to determine the best legal strategy for your specific situation.</p>
