<p>Delays in property transactions can be frustrating and may lead to legal disputes between the parties involved. In the Philippines, property transactions are governed by various laws, including the Civil Code and the Property Registration Decree. Delays can occur due to several reasons, such as incomplete documentation, disputes over property boundaries, or issues with the property's title.</p><p>To address these delays, parties involved in the transaction should first identify the root cause. If the delay is due to the seller's failure to fulfill contractual obligations, the buyer may demand specific performance or seek rescission of the contract with damages. In cases where the delay is caused by external factors, such as issues with government agencies, both parties may need to cooperate to resolve the matter efficiently.</p><p>Engaging a lawyer who specializes in real estate law can be beneficial in navigating the complexities of property transactions. The lawyer can assist in reviewing contracts, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and representing the client in any legal actions that may arise from the delay.</p>
