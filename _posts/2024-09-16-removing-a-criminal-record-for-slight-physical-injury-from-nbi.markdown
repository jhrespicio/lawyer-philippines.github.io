<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Is it possible to remove a criminal record for slight physical injury from my NBI clearance?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, once a case has been filed in court, it will reflect on your NBI clearance. If the case has been dismissed or if you’ve been acquitted, you may file a petition for expungement to remove it from your record. However, if you were convicted, the record will stay, although you may apply for probation if eligible. You may consult with a lawyer to guide you through the necessary legal steps to clear your name. It’s also possible to file for a clearance update with the NBI if the case has been resolved in your favor.</p>
