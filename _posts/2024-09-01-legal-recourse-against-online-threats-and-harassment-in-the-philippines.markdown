<p>In the age of social media, online threats and harassment have become increasingly common, affecting individuals' privacy and security. Under Philippine law, such acts can be considered forms of cybercrime, particularly under Republic Act No. 10175, also known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.</p><p>If someone threatens to post your face on social media or contact everyone on your phone book as a form of harassment, these actions may constitute cyber libel, identity theft, or unjust vexation. Cyber libel occurs when defamatory statements are made online, while identity theft involves the unauthorized use of personal information to harm or deceive others. Unjust vexation, although a less severe offense, can still lead to penalties if it causes undue annoyance or disturbance.</p><p>Victims of online threats and harassment have legal options to protect themselves. First, it is crucial to document all evidence of the threats, including screenshots, chat logs, and any other relevant digital communications. This evidence will be vital when filing a complaint with the authorities.</p><p>Victims can file a complaint with the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) or the National Bureau of Investigation Cybercrime Division (NBI-CCD). These agencies are equipped to handle cases of cybercrime and can initiate investigations to identify and prosecute the perpetrators. In severe cases, the victim may also seek a protection order from the court to prevent further harassment.</p><p>Online harassment is a serious matter, and Philippine law provides mechanisms to protect individuals from such threats. Legal action, when necessary, can help stop the harassment and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.</p>
