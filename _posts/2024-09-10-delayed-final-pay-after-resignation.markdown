<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I resigned from my job in October, but I have yet to receive my final pay. The company has informed me that it is still awaiting approval from the Vice President. What legal options do I have to expedite this process?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, an employer is required to release the final pay of an employee, which includes unpaid salaries, pro-rated 13th-month pay, and other benefits, within 30 days of resignation or termination. If your employer is delaying this process beyond the legally mandated period, you can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) through their Single Entry Approach (SEnA) program. This allows for mediation between you and the employer to resolve the issue amicably. If mediation does not work, you can pursue a formal labor complaint against the employer to claim your final pay and any damages due to the delay.</p>
