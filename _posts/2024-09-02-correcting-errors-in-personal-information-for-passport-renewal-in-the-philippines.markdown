<p>Correcting errors in personal information, such as a middle name, on a Philippine passport is a common concern. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) allows individuals to renew their passports with the correct information, provided that they submit the necessary documentation to support the changes. The first step is to secure a copy of the corrected birth certificate from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reflecting the accurate middle name. This document serves as the primary proof of identity and is required for any amendments to be made in the passport.</p><p>During the passport renewal process, the applicant must present the corrected PSA birth certificate, along with other standard requirements such as the current or previous passport, valid ID, and a duly accomplished passport renewal application form. The DFA will then process the application and issue a new passport with the corrected information.</p><p>It is advisable to inform the passport officer during the application process about the correction in the middle name to ensure that the changes are accurately reflected in the new passport. This process helps avoid potential issues with immigration or when using the passport for official transactions abroad. Always double-check the information on the passport upon receipt to ensure that all corrections have been made accurately.</p>
