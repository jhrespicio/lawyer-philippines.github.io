<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am concerned about a case of child abuse in my community. I would like to know if the authorities can arrest the suspect without a warrant?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, child abuse is considered a serious crime and may be subject to a warrantless arrest under specific circumstances. According to Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, a warrantless arrest may be valid when the crime is being committed in the presence of an officer, or if the officer has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the suspect has just committed the offense. Since child abuse often involves physical or emotional harm, if these acts are observed by law enforcement or reported immediately after the incident, a warrantless arrest may be justifiable.</p>
