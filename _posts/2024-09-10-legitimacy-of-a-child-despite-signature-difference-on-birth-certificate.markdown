<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I noticed that my father's signature on my birth certificate does not match his usual signature. Will this discrepancy affect the legitimacy of a child in any way? Is the child still considered legitimate?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>The legitimacy of a child is not affected by discrepancies in the signature of the father on the birth certificate. Legitimacy is based on the legal recognition of the parents' marriage at the time of the child's birth. The birth certificate serves as prima facie evidence of the facts stated, including the identity of the parents. However, a difference in the signature does not invalidate the legitimacy of the child. If there are any issues regarding the birth certificateâ€™s validity or authenticity, you may need to have it corrected through proper legal procedures by filing a petition for correction of entry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.</p>
