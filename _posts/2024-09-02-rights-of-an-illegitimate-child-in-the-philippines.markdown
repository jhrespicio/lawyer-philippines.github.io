<p>In the Philippines, the rights of an illegitimate child are protected under the law. According to the Family Code of the Philippines, an illegitimate child is entitled to support and inheritance from their biological parents. The child has the right to bear the surname of their mother, and in some cases, the surname of their father if the latter recognizes the child.</p><p>An illegitimate child is entitled to receive support from their biological parents. This support includes basic necessities such as food, shelter, education, and medical care. The right to support is a natural right that cannot be renounced or transferred. Parents, regardless of their marital status, are obligated to provide for their children.</p><p>Regarding inheritance, an illegitimate child is entitled to a portion of their biological parent’s estate, though their share is typically less than that of a legitimate child. The law provides that an illegitimate child is entitled to half of what a legitimate child would receive as an inheritance. For instance, if a legitimate child is entitled to one full share of the inheritance, an illegitimate child would be entitled to one-half of that share.</p><p>It is important to note that the legal wife of a father has no right to withhold the share of inheritance or support that is due to an illegitimate child. The law is clear that the rights of an illegitimate child cannot be denied or diminished based on the status of the parents' relationship. If an illegitimate child’s rights are being violated, legal remedies are available, including filing a petition in court to claim the rightful share of support or inheritance.</p>
