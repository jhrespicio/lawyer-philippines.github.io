<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I would like to inquire about my entitlement to my final pay. What legal processes should I follow to ensure I receive the full amount owed to me? Can I take any legal action if my employer refuses to provide it?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Under Philippine labor laws, specifically Article 297 of the Labor Code, an employee who resigns or is terminated is entitled to final pay, which includes unpaid wages, accrued leave benefits, and 13th month pay. Employers are required to release the final pay within 30 days of an employeeâ€™s separation from service. If your employer refuses to release it, you can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for the proper computation and release of your final pay. It's also advisable to review any employment contracts or company policies that might impact your claim.</p>
