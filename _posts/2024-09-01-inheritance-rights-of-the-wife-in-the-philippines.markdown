<p>In the Philippines, inheritance laws are governed by the Civil Code, which outlines the legal rights of heirs, including the wife, to the estate of a deceased spouse. Under the Civil Code, the wife has a right to inherit from her husbandâ€™s estate, regardless of the regime of property relations they had during the marriage.</p><p>If the couple was married under the regime of absolute community of property or conjugal partnership of gains, the wife is entitled to her share of the community or conjugal property. Additionally, the wife is considered a compulsory heir, meaning she is entitled to a portion of her husband's estate, even if the husband left a will that states otherwise.</p><p>In cases where the husband dies intestate (without a will), the wife will inherit alongside the legitimate children of the deceased, according to the rules of intestate succession. If there are no children, the wife may inherit the entire estate. It is essential for spouses to understand their rights under Philippine inheritance laws to ensure proper estate planning and protection of their interests.</p>
