<p>In the Philippines, the unauthorized entry into another person’s property is classified as trespass under the Revised Penal Code. Trespass involves the illegal entry into a property owned by another person without the latter's consent. This act is punishable under Article 280 of the Revised Penal Code. When such trespass is accompanied by the unlawful taking of property, such as agricultural produce, the offense may escalate to theft.</p><p>Theft is defined under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code as the taking of personal property belonging to another without the latter’s consent, with intent to gain, and without the use of violence or intimidation. Agricultural products, including root crops like cassava, are considered personal property. Therefore, the unauthorized harvesting and taking of these products from another’s property can be considered theft.</p><p>Victims of such crimes can file a complaint with the local police or directly with the prosecutor's office. The complaint should include evidence of ownership of the property, evidence of the unauthorized entry, and proof of the theft. Witness statements, photographs, and receipts or other documentation of ownership can all be valuable pieces of evidence.</p><p>The filing of a criminal complaint may lead to the issuance of a warrant of arrest against the accused, followed by trial and, if found guilty, the imposition of penalties, which may include imprisonment and fines. It is advisable for victims to consult a lawyer to navigate the legal processes effectively and ensure their rights are protected.</p>
