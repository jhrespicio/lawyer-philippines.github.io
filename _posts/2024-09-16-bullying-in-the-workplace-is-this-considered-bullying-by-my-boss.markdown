<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My boss seems to single me out at work. For example, they openly mention in front of others that my coworkers are being given perks or benefits, but I am intentionally excluded. Is this considered workplace bullying, and what legal actions can I take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Workplace bullying is a serious concern under Philippine labor laws. In your situation, if your boss's actions are causing a hostile work environment, such as singling you out for negative treatment, this could be considered bullying. Under the Philippine Safe Spaces Act (RA 11313) and Labor Code provisions, you may report this to your company's human resources department or file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Document all incidents and consider consulting with an attorney if the behavior persists.</p>
