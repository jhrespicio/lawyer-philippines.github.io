<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to ask if a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) has an expiration. I was asked for another SPA for a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS), but I already sent a consularized copy previously. Does my existing SPA expire?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In general, a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) does not have an automatic expiration unless specifically stated in the document. However, if the SPA is for a specific transaction, such as the execution of a Deed of Absolute Sale (DOAS), it is valid only for the duration of the transaction. If the SPA is consularized or notarized, it should still be valid unless circumstances, such as the death or incapacity of the principal, revoke it. It is advisable to check if the requesting party has specific requirements or concerns regarding the document, as sometimes institutions or parties require updated versions of an SPA.</p>
