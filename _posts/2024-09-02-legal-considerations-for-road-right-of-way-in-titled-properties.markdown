<p>In the Philippines, a road right-of-way is an easement that allows access through a property, typically for public use or to provide access to another property. When a road right-of-way is established on a registered property, it becomes part of the property’s legal encumbrances. However, it cannot be segregated from the main property and issued a separate certificate of title. The right-of-way is an accessory to the main property and serves a specific purpose, which is to provide access. The easement does not grant ownership of the land within the right-of-way to another party, but it does restrict the property owner’s use of that portion of the land. In the event that the property is sold or transferred, the right-of-way continues to exist and must be respected by the new owner. The establishment of a road right-of-way typically requires a legal process, which may involve negotiations between the affected parties or, in some cases, expropriation proceedings by the government.</p>
