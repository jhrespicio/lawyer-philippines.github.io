<p>Online lending scams have become increasingly prevalent in the Philippines, with many individuals falling victim to fraudulent schemes that promise quick loans but end up extorting money. Victims often communicate with scammers through messaging apps like Telegram, making it difficult to trace the perpetrators. If you or someone you know has been scammed, it is crucial to take immediate action. First, report the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG). Provide all evidence, including screenshots of conversations, proof of payments, and other relevant information. Additionally, inform your bank to monitor suspicious transactions and consider freezing your account to prevent further losses. Victims should also be aware that the use of fake identification and documents by scammers complicates the situation, making legal recourse essential. Legal advice should be sought to explore potential avenues for recovering lost funds and prosecuting the scammers.</p>
