<p>A warrant of arrest is a legal document issued by a judge or a competent authority that authorizes law enforcement officers to arrest a person accused of a crime. In the Philippines, the issuance of an arrest warrant is governed by the Rules of Court, specifically Rule 113.</p><p>An arrest warrant is typically issued after a complaint is filed and the judge finds probable cause that a crime has been committed and that the accused is likely responsible. The warrant must clearly identify the person to be arrested and the nature of the offense. It serves as a formal order that must be executed by law enforcement officials.</p><p>Once a warrant of arrest is issued, the accused has the right to be informed of the charges against them and to seek legal representation. The accused may also file a motion to quash the warrant if they believe it was issued without proper basis. Additionally, the accused can apply for bail, depending on the nature of the crime, to secure temporary release while awaiting trial.</p><p>Understanding the process and implications of an arrest warrant is crucial for anyone involved in a legal case in the Philippines. Legal counsel should be sought immediately upon the issuance of an arrest warrant to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected throughout the judicial process.</p>
