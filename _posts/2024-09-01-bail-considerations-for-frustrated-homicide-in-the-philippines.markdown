<p>In the Philippine legal system, bail is a crucial right granted to an accused individual, allowing temporary liberty while awaiting trial. Under Philippine law, the crime of frustrated homicide is treated seriously, as it involves an attempt to take a person's life, which, although unsuccessful, demonstrates a clear intent to kill.</p><p>The determination of bail for frustrated homicide is guided by several factors, primarily the gravity of the offense and the penalty prescribed by law. According to the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, frustrated homicide is punishable by prision mayor, which ranges from six years and one day to twelve years in prison.</p><p>Given the seriousness of the crime, bail is not automatically granted. The court will assess the evidence presented by the prosecution to determine the strength of the case against the accused. If the evidence is strong, the court may either deny bail or set it at a high amount to ensure the accused does not abscond and remains present throughout the trial.</p><p>Furthermore, the court considers the accused's risk of flight, prior criminal record, and the potential danger posed to the community if released. In cases where the accused poses a significant flight risk or if there is a likelihood of committing further crimes, the court may deny bail altogether.</p><p>It is also important to note that under the Philippine Constitution, all persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong. Thus, while frustrated homicide is a bailable offense, the amount and conditions of bail will vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to grant bail and the amount set are at the discretion of the judge, who must balance the rights of the accused with the need to protect the community and ensure the integrity of the judicial process.</p>
