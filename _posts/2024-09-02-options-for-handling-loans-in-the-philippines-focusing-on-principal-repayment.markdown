<p>Borrowers in the Philippines who find themselves struggling with loan repayments may seek options to alleviate their financial burden. One approach is to negotiate with the lender for a repayment plan that focuses on paying off the principal amount of the loan rather than the interest or other charges. This negotiation can be initiated directly with the lender, where the borrower explains their financial situation and proposes a payment plan that prioritizes the principal. While lenders are not obligated to agree to such terms, many are willing to renegotiate to recover the principal amount rather than risk non-payment. Additionally, borrowers may consider seeking assistance from a debt relief program or consulting with a legal advisor who can provide guidance on managing debts and negotiating more favorable terms with creditors.</p>
