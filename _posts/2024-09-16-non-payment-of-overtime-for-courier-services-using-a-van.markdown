<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I work as a courier for a delivery company, and we use a van for deliveries. However, we are not being paid overtime. Is this legal, and what are our rights as employees?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, all employees, except those classified as managerial or supervisory, are entitled to overtime pay when working beyond the standard 8-hour workday. This includes workers in the delivery and courier services sector, regardless of whether you use a van or other delivery vehicles. Employers are required to compensate their employees with an additional 25% of the regular wage for work performed beyond 8 hours on a regular workday. If you believe that your rights are being violated, you can raise your concern with your employer or file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for proper enforcement of labor laws.</p>
