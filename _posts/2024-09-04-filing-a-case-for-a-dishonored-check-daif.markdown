<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I was issued a check as payment, but it was dishonored due to insufficient funds (DAIF). The issuer is from Tagaytay, and I am based in Manila. Where should I file the case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Under the law, cases involving dishonored checks (Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 or the Bouncing Checks Law) must be filed in the appropriate jurisdiction where the check was issued or where it was dishonored. In your case, since you deposited the check in Manila and it was dishonored there, you can file the case in the prosecutorâ€™s office in Manila. It is advisable to act quickly as there are time limitations for filing such cases. Consulting with a lawyer can help you gather the necessary documents, such as the check itself and the bank certification of dishonor, to build a strong case.</p>
