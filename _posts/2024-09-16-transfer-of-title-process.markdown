<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am seeking general information regarding the transfer of a property title. What steps are usually involved in transferring the title after purchasing a property?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Transferring a property title in the Philippines generally involves several steps. First, the Deed of Sale must be executed and notarized. Both the seller and buyer should ensure that all taxes, such as the Capital Gains Tax and Documentary Stamp Tax, are settled, as these are prerequisites for transferring the title. Next, the transaction must be submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for processing the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR). After the CAR is issued, the buyer should proceed to the local Registry of Deeds to update the title to reflect their name. The last step is updating the tax declaration at the local assessor’s office to ensure that the property is listed under the new owner’s name.</p>
