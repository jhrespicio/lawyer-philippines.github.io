<p>Under Philippine law, the rights of an illegitimate child, particularly in terms of inheritance, are distinct from those of a legitimate child. The Family Code of the Philippines defines an illegitimate child as one born to parents who are not legally married to each other, and this status affects their rights concerning inheritance. While an illegitimate child does have rights to inherit from their biological parents, these rights are limited compared to those of a legitimate child.</p><p>In terms of inheritance, an illegitimate child is entitled to receive a portion of the estate of their deceased parent, referred to as their ‘legitime.’ This share is typically half of what a legitimate child would receive. However, it is important to note that during the lifetime of the legal spouse or the legitimate family, an illegitimate child cannot lay claim to any specific property owned by the parents. Property disputes and claims by illegitimate children generally arise upon the death of the parent, when the estate is subject to division.</p><p>In scenarios where an illegitimate child seeks to claim property while the legal parents are still alive, the law does not grant them any direct entitlement to such property. Instead, the legal rights concerning property and inheritance are addressed through the proper channels, such as a legal process following the parent’s death. Thus, while an illegitimate child has recognized inheritance rights, these are not enforceable against the property of living legal parents.</p>
