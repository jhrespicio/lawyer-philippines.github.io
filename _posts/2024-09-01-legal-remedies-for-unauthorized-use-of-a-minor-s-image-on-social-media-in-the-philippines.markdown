<p>In the Philippines, the unauthorized use of a minor’s image on social media platforms such as Facebook can be a serious legal issue, particularly when the image is used without the consent of the minor’s parents or guardians. The use of a child's image without permission can lead to several legal actions under Philippine law.</p><p>The most relevant legal recourse is filing a complaint for a violation of Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012. This law protects the privacy of individuals, including minors, by regulating the collection, handling, and processing of personal data. Under this act, the unauthorized use or sharing of a minor’s image without proper consent is a violation, and the responsible party can be held liable.</p><p>In addition to the Data Privacy Act, parents or guardians can file a case for violation of Republic Act No. 7610, also known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act. This law provides protection for children against all forms of abuse, including the exploitation of their images for unlawful purposes.</p><p>Another possible remedy is to file a complaint for cyber libel under Republic Act No. 10175, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, if the image is used in a manner that defames or discredits the minor. This act covers offenses committed through computer systems or similar means, including the unauthorized use and dissemination of images.</p><p>Parents or guardians who find that their child’s image has been used without consent on social media should immediately document the violation and seek legal advice to determine the most appropriate course of action.</p>
