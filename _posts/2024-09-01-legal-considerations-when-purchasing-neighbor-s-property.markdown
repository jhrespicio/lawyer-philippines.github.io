<p>When purchasing property from a neighbor in the Philippines, it is essential to ensure that the transaction is conducted legally and properly documented. This includes verifying the property's title to ensure it is free from encumbrances, understanding any existing easements or rights of way, and ensuring the sale is recorded in the Registry of Deeds. The buyer should also be aware of their rights and obligations under the law, including the need to pay the appropriate taxes and fees, such as documentary stamp tax, transfer tax, and registration fees. Additionally, it is advisable to have a formal contract of sale prepared and notarized to protect both parties' interests.</p>
