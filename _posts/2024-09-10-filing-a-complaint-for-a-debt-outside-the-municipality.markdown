<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I want to file a complaint at the barangay regarding a debt that has been outstanding for four years. I live in Daraga, Albay, and the person I am complaining about resides in Tiwi, Albay. The barangay advised me to go to the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) because I live outside the municipality. What is the correct process for this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Since you and the person you are complaining about reside in different municipalities, barangay conciliation may not be the proper venue for resolving your dispute. When the parties live in separate municipalities, the Barangay Justice System may not have jurisdiction over the matter. Instead, you can directly file a complaint at the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) where the defendant resides or where the transaction occurred. It is recommended to consult with a lawyer to ensure the correct legal procedures are followed.</p>
