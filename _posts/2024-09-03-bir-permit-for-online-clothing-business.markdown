Additionally, there may be costs associated with securing other local permits (e.g., Mayor's Permit) and registering with other government agencies, such as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>It is advisable to consult directly with the BIR or a tax professional to get a precise estimate of the costs based on your specific business circumstances.
