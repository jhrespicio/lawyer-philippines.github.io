<p>The termination of employees in the Philippines is governed by the Labor Code, which sets out strict grounds and procedures that employers must follow. Employers cannot arbitrarily dismiss employees; termination must be based on just or authorized causes. Just causes include serious misconduct, willful disobedience, and gross negligence, among others. Authorized causes include redundancy, retrenchment, or the closure of a business. If an employer wishes to replace an employee, the dismissal must fall under one of these authorized causes, such as redundancy, which requires the position to be deemed unnecessary. Even then, due process must be observed, including giving the employee written notice and the opportunity to respond to the reason for termination. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in a finding of illegal dismissal, which can obligate the employer to reinstate the employee or pay damages, including back wages and separation pay.</p>
