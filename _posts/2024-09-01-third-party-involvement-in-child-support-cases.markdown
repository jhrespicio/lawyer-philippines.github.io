<p>In child support cases in the Philippines, the involvement of third parties, such as a new partner of an ex-spouse, can complicate matters. While the new partner may express concerns or opinions, legal standing in child support cases is generally limited to the parents of the child. Any agreements or disputes about child support should be resolved between the parents, with the involvement of barangay officials or the court if necessary. Third-party interference can be seen as inappropriate and may be addressed through legal channels if it leads to harassment or undue influence.</p>
