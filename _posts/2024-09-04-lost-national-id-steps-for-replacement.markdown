<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I recently lost my National ID. What is the process for getting a replacement?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>If you lose your National ID in the Philippines, the first step is to report the loss immediately. You may file a police report to document the incident, which will be useful for future reference and in case of potential misuse.</p><p>To request a replacement, you can visit a PhilSys Registration Center (at selected government offices) or authorized SM Business Centers. Bring your police report and any valid government-issued IDs to process the application. You will be required to pay a minimal fee for the replacement.</p><p>The new card will be processed and issued after verification of your information. Make sure to safeguard your new ID to avoid repeating the process in the future.</p>
