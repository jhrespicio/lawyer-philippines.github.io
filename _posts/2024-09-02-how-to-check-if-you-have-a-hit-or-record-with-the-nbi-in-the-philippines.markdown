<p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in the Philippines maintains a database of individuals who have been involved in legal cases, whether as complainants, respondents, or convicts. A 'hit' on an NBI clearance occurs when an individual's name appears in the database, indicating a possible record or pending case.</p><p>To check if you have a hit or record with the NBI, the first step is to apply for an NBI clearance. The process can be done online or at any NBI clearance center. During the application, you will provide personal details that the NBI will use to search their database.</p><p>If a hit is found, the NBI will require you to undergo verification, which involves an interview with an NBI officer to confirm whether the record pertains to you or is merely a case of mistaken identity. In some cases, the hit may result from a namesake being involved in a legal issue, in which case, additional documents may be required to clear your name.</p><p>If the hit is confirmed to be related to you, the NBI will advise you on the next steps, which may include resolving any outstanding legal issues or cases. It is crucial to resolve any hits promptly, as they can affect employment, travel, or other personal matters where an NBI clearance is required.</p><p>For individuals with confirmed records, legal assistance may be necessary to address any ongoing cases or to request corrections or updates to their NBI record. It is recommended to regularly check your NBI status, especially before applying for jobs or visas.</p>
