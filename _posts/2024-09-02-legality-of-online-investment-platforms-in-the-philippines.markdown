<p>Online investment platforms have proliferated in recent years, providing Filipinos with various opportunities to grow their money. However, not all of these platforms operate legally. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the Philippines regulates investment companies and requires them to obtain the necessary licenses to operate legally. Investors must ensure that any platform they engage with is registered with the SEC to avoid falling victim to fraudulent schemes. The SEC regularly updates its list of registered companies, and it is crucial for investors to check this list before investing. Victims of illegal investment schemes can report these activities to the SEC for proper investigation and action.</p>
