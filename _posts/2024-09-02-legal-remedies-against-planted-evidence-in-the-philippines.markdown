<p>In the Philippines, being falsely accused due to planted evidence is a grave violation of one’s rights. If someone is arrested based on planted evidence, such as illegal drugs placed in their vehicle or property, they have the right to challenge the legality of the arrest and the evidence itself. The Constitution of the Philippines guarantees protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and any evidence obtained in violation of this right can be deemed inadmissible in court under the ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine. A person in this situation can file a motion to quash the evidence during the trial, arguing that it was planted and thus, cannot be used against them. Additionally, they can pursue legal actions against the perpetrators, including filing a criminal complaint for planting evidence, which is punishable under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (RA 9165). This law imposes severe penalties on law enforcement officials or private individuals who plant evidence with the intent to incriminate another person.</p>
