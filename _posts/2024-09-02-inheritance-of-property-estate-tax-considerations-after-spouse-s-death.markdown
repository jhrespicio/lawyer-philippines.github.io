<p>In the Philippines, inheritance and the transfer of property upon death are governed by laws that ensure the orderly distribution of a decedent’s estate to their heirs. When a married person inherits property from their parents, the property is generally considered conjugal or community property, depending on the marriage regime applicable to the couple. If the property was inherited during the marriage, it may be classified as part of the conjugal partnership or absolute community, unless explicitly stated as separate property in a marriage settlement.</p><p>Upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse typically retains their share of the conjugal or community property, while the deceased spouse’s share becomes part of their estate and is subject to distribution among the heirs. The estate of the deceased is subject to estate tax before the property can be legally transferred to the heirs. The estate tax is calculated based on the net value of the deceased’s estate, which includes their share of the conjugal or community property.</p><p>In cases where the property title states ‘married to’ and the spouse has passed away, the surviving spouse must first settle the estate tax of the deceased spouse to facilitate the transfer of the title to the heirs. Once the estate tax is paid, the title can be reissued in the name of the surviving spouse and the heirs, which typically include the children. The process involves securing a Certificate of Authority to Register from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and processing the title transfer with the Registry of Deeds.</p><p>It is important to consult with a legal expert in estate law to navigate the complexities of estate settlement, tax obligations, and title transfer procedures. Proper legal guidance ensures compliance with legal requirements and helps avoid potential disputes among heirs.</p>
