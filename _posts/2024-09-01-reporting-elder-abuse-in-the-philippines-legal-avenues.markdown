<p>Elder abuse is a serious issue in the Philippines and can take many forms, including neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and financial exploitation. The Anti-Elder Abuse Law, while still pending in Congress, reflects the growing recognition of the need to protect elderly citizens. In the absence of a specific law, cases of elder abuse can be reported under existing laws such as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act if the abuse occurs within a domestic setting. Additionally, reports can be made to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), which can intervene to protect the elderly and provide necessary support services.</p>
