<p>Boundary disputes between neighbors are common in the Philippines and can often escalate into legal conflicts. If a neighbor constructs a wall or any structure that encroaches on your property, you have the right to demand its removal. The first step is to engage in amicable discussions with your neighbor to resolve the issue. If this fails, you may file a complaint with the Barangay for mediation. Should mediation not succeed, the next step is to bring the matter to court, where a judge may order a survey to determine the exact boundaries. It is crucial to have proper documentation, such as a certified copy of the land title and a professional surveyorâ€™s report, to support your claims. Legal intervention ensures that property rights are respected and that any encroachments are addressed according to the law.</p>
