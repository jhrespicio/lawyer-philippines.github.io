<p>Selling a condominium in the Philippines involves several legal steps and considerations to ensure a smooth and lawful transaction. First and foremost, the seller must possess a clear and marketable title to the property, which means the condominium certificate of title (CCT) must be free from any liens, encumbrances, or legal disputes. Before proceeding with the sale, it is advisable to obtain a certified true copy of the CCT from the Register of Deeds to verify the status of the property. The seller is also required to settle all outstanding obligations related to the property, including real property taxes, association dues, and any mortgage or loans tied to the condominium. Upon agreeing on the sale price, the parties typically execute a Contract to Sell, which outlines the terms and conditions of the sale. Once the buyer fulfills the payment obligations, the parties then execute a Deed of Absolute Sale. This document transfers ownership from the seller to the buyer and must be notarized to be legally binding. Following this, the buyer is responsible for paying the capital gains tax (if applicable) and documentary stamp tax, while the seller typically handles the payment of broker fees and other incidental expenses. The final step involves the registration of the sale with the Register of Deeds, where the buyer&#39;s name will be officially recorded as the new owner on the CCT. It is crucial for both parties to comply with these legal requirements to avoid future disputes and ensure the transfer of ownership is legally recognized.</p>
