<p>In the Philippines, accurate personal information is essential for legal documents, including those requiring notarization. If there is a minor error, such as a misspelled middle name, it may still be possible to have the document notarized, but it is generally advisable to correct any inaccuracies before doing so. To correct a spelling error in a legal document, the concerned party may need to execute an affidavit of correction, which must then be notarized. Ensuring that all personal information is accurate before notarization helps avoid potential legal complications or disputes in the future.</p>
