<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I was scammed out of PHP 85,000 and I know the scammer’s bank details at CIMB Philippines. I was informed that a court order is needed to access his account details. Can you assist me with this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> In fraud cases like this, you can file a criminal complaint for estafa under the Revised Penal Code. To access the scammer's bank account details, a court order is indeed required as banks are bound by confidentiality laws, specifically the Bank Secrecy Law. A lawyer can help you file the necessary criminal or civil actions, and once a case is filed, the court may issue an order to release relevant bank information. Pursuing legal action will enable you to recover the lost funds, assuming the scammer’s identity is verified and proven in court.</p>
