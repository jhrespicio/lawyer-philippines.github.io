<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If I am facing a bailable case for violating Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, how much should I expect to pay for legal representation? Could you provide an estimate of the lawyer's fees for such a case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code refers to justifying circumstances, which may exempt a person from criminal liability. However, if you are facing criminal charges for which bail is granted, the amount of bail is set by the court depending on the severity of the offense. Lawyer's fees for representing a client in criminal cases can vary widely. Factors such as the complexity of the case, the lawyer's experience, and the location where the case is being heard can influence the cost. Generally, for a bailable case, attorneys may charge between PHP 50,000 to PHP 200,000 for representation, though this could be higher for more serious cases. It is recommended to consult directly with a lawyer to obtain a more precise estimate based on the specifics of the case.</p>
