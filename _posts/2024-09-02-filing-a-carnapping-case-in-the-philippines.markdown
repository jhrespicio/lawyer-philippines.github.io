<p>In the Philippines, the crime of carnapping is a serious offense governed by Republic Act No. 10883, also known as the New Anti-Carnapping Act of 2016. Filing a carnapping case typically begins with reporting the incident to the nearest police station, where a blotter report is created. The case does not necessarily need to be filed through the barangay. The police will investigate the matter, and if there is sufficient evidence, the case will be forwarded to the prosecutorâ€™s office for preliminary investigation. Victims are encouraged to provide any evidence they have, such as vehicle registration, photographs, or witnesses. The prosecutor will determine if there is probable cause to file the case in court. If the case progresses, it will be heard in the appropriate court of law, where the offender could face penalties including imprisonment and fines depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
