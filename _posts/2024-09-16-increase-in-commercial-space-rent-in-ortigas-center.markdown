<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I have a commercial space in Ortigas Center, Pasig that I am renting for PHP 135,000 per month. I would like to know what the standard rate of increase is for rent in this area. Can you provide guidance on this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>The determination of rent increases for commercial spaces is generally governed by the terms of the lease contract. There is no standardized percentage increase for commercial rents in the Philippines, as rent adjustments are usually negotiated between the lessor and the lessee. In some cases, lease agreements may include provisions that allow for periodic increases, such as an annual percentage increase or adjustments based on prevailing market rates.</p><p>It is important to review the terms of your lease contract to determine if a rate increase is stipulated. You may also consult with a real estate professional or attorney to help you navigate lease renewal negotiations and understand the current market rates in Ortigas Center.</p>
