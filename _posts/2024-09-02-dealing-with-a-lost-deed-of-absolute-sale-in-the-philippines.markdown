<p>The deed of absolute sale is a critical document that serves as proof of ownership transfer from the seller to the buyer of real property in the Philippines. However, there are instances where this document may be lost, especially in cases where the sale occurred many years ago. If the deed of absolute sale is lost, the owner must take several steps to rectify the situation and secure their ownership rights.</p><p>Firstly, it is essential to secure a certified true copy of the deed from the Registry of Deeds where the property is located. The Registry of Deeds keeps records of all transactions involving real property, and obtaining a certified copy can serve as a substitute for the original lost document.</p><p>If the Registry of Deeds does not have a copy, the owner may need to execute an affidavit of loss. This affidavit should detail the circumstances under which the deed was lost and must be notarized. The affidavit of loss is a crucial document as it will be required in any subsequent legal processes or when dealing with government agencies.</p><p>In some cases, if disputes arise or there is a need to prove ownership, it may be necessary to file a petition for reconstitution of the lost deed of sale before the Regional Trial Court. This court process is more involved and may require presenting evidence such as tax declarations, previous contracts, and witness testimonies to establish ownership.</p><p>To prevent future complications, it is advisable to keep multiple copies of important documents like the deed of absolute sale and to update records with the Registry of Deeds regularly. Additionally, registering the property under the buyerâ€™s name at the Registry of Deeds and paying all necessary taxes and fees ensure the property is legally recognized as theirs.</p>
