<p>When an individual is accused of a crime in the Philippines, they are entitled to certain legal rights and protections under the Constitution and existing laws. The legal process begins with the filing of a complaint by the offended party, followed by a preliminary investigation conducted by the prosecutor's office to determine if there is probable cause to charge the accused in court. If probable cause is established, the prosecutor will file an information in court, and the accused will be arraigned, during which they will enter a plea. The accused has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them, the right to legal representation, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to confront witnesses. If the accused cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint one to represent them. Throughout the trial, the prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused also has the right to present evidence in their defense and to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses. If convicted, the accused has the right to appeal the decision to a higher court. The legal process is designed to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected and that justice is served fairly and impartially.</p>
