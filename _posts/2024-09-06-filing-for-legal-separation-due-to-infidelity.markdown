<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My husband and I have been estranged since 2019 due to his infidelity. I would like to know if I can file for legal separation or arrange a legal agreement, especially since we have two children.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Yes, you may file for legal separation in the Philippines based on infidelity, which is considered as "sexual infidelity" under Article 55 of the Family Code of the Philippines. If your husbandâ€™s infidelity was proven and has caused a breach in your marriage, this serves as a valid ground to file for legal separation.</p><p>Additionally, you may explore options for child custody and support agreements. Although legal separation does not dissolve the marriage, it allows you to live separately, settle property relations, and formalize child custody and support arrangements. It is advisable to consult with a family lawyer to begin this process.</p>
