<p>In the Philippines, the age of criminal responsibility is a critical factor in determining the legal consequences for both the offender and those involved in a criminal case. Under the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act (Republic Act No. 9344), minors below 15 years of age are exempt from criminal liability, although they may still be subject to intervention programs. If an accused person unknowingly interacts with minors during the commission of an alleged offense, their lack of knowledge may be considered during legal proceedings. However, this does not absolve them from legal responsibility, particularly if the offense is severe. The law encourages the protection of minors, and any interactions with them during criminal activities must be carefully examined within the legal framework.</p>
