<p>Single parents, particularly those who have been abandoned or are raising children without substantial support from the other parent, face unique challenges. In the Philippines, child support is a legal obligation that both parents must fulfill, regardless of marital status. The law mandates that the non-custodial parent provide financial assistance for the upbringing of their children. This support should cover basic needs such as food, clothing, education, and medical care. However, enforcing child support can be challenging, especially if the other parent is uncooperative or has entered into a new marriage.</p><p>If a parent fails to provide adequate support, the custodial parent has the right to seek legal remedies. The custodial parent may file a petition for child support in the family court, where the court will determine the amount of support based on the financial capacity of both parents and the needs of the child. In cases where the non-custodial parent has remarried, the obligation to support children from a previous relationship remains. The court may garnish wages or order other legal measures to ensure compliance.</p><p>For parents dealing with children who have special needs, such as those with seizure disorders, additional financial support may be required. The court can order the non-custodial parent to provide a higher level of support to cover the cost of medical care, therapy, and other necessary expenses. Legal advice from a family lawyer is recommended to navigate these complex situations effectively.</p>
