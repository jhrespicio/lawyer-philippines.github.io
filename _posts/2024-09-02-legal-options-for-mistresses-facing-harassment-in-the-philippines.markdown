<p>In the Philippines, extramarital affairs are viewed seriously, and the legal implications for all parties involved can be severe. If a mistress receives threats from the legal spouse, such as the dissemination of compromising photos or messages to her family, this could constitute acts punishable under the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act (RA 9262) or under the Revised Penal Code as libel or grave threats, depending on the nature of the communication.</p><p>However, the legal wife also has the right to take action against the mistress, particularly if the affair resulted in psychological or emotional harm. While the legal grounds for filing a case against the mistress herself may be limited, the legal wife may pursue an action for concubinage against her husband. It is advisable for the mistress to seek legal counsel to explore options for protecting herself from harassment while understanding the potential legal consequences of her involvement in the affair.</p>
