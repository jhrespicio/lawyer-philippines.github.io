<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I forgot my TIN number and I currently do not have an ID. How can I retrieve my TIN number without a valid identification document?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If youâ€™ve forgotten your Tax Identification Number (TIN) and do not have an ID, you can still retrieve it through various options. First, you can visit the nearest Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) office and provide other details like your full name, date of birth, and address. BIR offices may also require alternative proofs of identity such as your birth certificate, school ID (if available), or any other documents that can prove your identity.</p><p>Alternatively, the BIR also has a Contact Center where you can inquire about your TIN by providing personal details over the phone. You may contact them through the BIR hotline at 981-8888 or email them at contact_us@bir.gov.ph. Some individuals may also retrieve their TIN using online services such as the BIR eREG TIN inquiry system if registered previously.</p>
