<p>In the Philippines, the imposition of interest rates on loans is regulated by law to protect borrowers from excessive and unconscionable charges. While lenders have the right to charge interest on loans, these rates must be within the bounds set by the law and must not be so high as to be considered usurious.</p><p>Republic Act No. 3765, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, mandates that lenders disclose all charges, including interest rates, to borrowers before the loan agreement is finalized. This law aims to ensure transparency and protect borrowers from hidden fees and excessive interest rates that could lead to financial hardship.</p><p>In 2013, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) issued Circular No. 799, which removed the ceilings on interest rates for loans, effectively deregulating the setting of interest rates. However, despite the removal of these ceilings, the principle of unconscionability still applies. Courts can void loan agreements where the interest rates are deemed unconscionable or excessively high, even in the absence of a statutory ceiling.</p><p>To determine whether an interest rate is unconscionable, the courts consider several factors, including the rate itself, the circumstances of the loan agreement, and the financial capacity of the borrower. If a borrower believes that the interest rate on their loan is excessively high, they can challenge it in court. The court may reduce the interest rate to a more reasonable level if it finds that the original rate is unjust.</p><p>Borrowers are advised to carefully review the terms of any loan agreement and seek legal counsel if they have concerns about the interest rates being charged. It is also important to document all communications with the lender and keep copies of the loan agreement and any related documents.</p><p>While interest is a necessary part of lending, it must be fair and within legal limits to prevent exploitation and ensure that borrowers are not unduly burdened by their financial obligations.</p>
