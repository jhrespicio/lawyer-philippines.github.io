<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I had an issue withdrawing funds from an online platform. I made small withdrawals without any problems, but when I tried to withdraw a larger amount, they asked for additional verification. I mistakenly used an ID for my cousin, who is underage, and now my account is blocked. I’m 23 years old, and I’ve already registered my phone number. Why did they ask for more verification after allowing earlier withdrawals? How can I resolve this issue?<br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Online platforms, especially those involved in financial transactions or gaming, often have stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to prevent fraud, underage gambling, and other violations. Even if previous small withdrawals were processed without additional verification, the platform may require stricter identity checks for larger sums to comply with regulatory requirements. Using an ID that does not belong to you, especially one showing an underage person, likely triggered the account suspension.<br>To resolve this, you should contact the platform’s customer service and explain the situation, providing your correct ID and proof of age. Be prepared to undergo a thorough review process, as violations of KYC rules can be considered serious. The platform has the right to block accounts if it suspects fraudulent or irregular activity. Cooperate with the investigation and ensure you follow the platform’s verification protocols moving forward.</p>
