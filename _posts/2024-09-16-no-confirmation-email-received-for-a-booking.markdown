<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I booked a service for tomorrow, but I have not yet received any email confirmation. What are my rights regarding this situation, and what steps should I take to protect myself?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you have not received any confirmation regarding your booking, you may want to review the terms and conditions of the service provider. Generally, a booking confirmation is considered a form of contract between you and the service provider. Without confirmation, there could be ambiguity about the status of your reservation. It is advisable to contact the service provider directly to clarify the status of your booking. Should the service provider fail to honor the booking and no proper service is provided, you may have grounds for filing a complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or a related consumer protection agency for a breach of contract or misrepresentation.</p>
