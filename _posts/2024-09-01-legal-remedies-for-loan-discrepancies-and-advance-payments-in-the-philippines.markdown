<p>In the Philippines, borrowers who encounter discrepancies in loan transactions, such as being asked to make advance payments that are not properly reflected in the system, have several legal remedies. Under the Consumer Act of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7394), financial institutions are required to ensure transparency and accuracy in their transactions. If a borrower is wrongly charged or their account is mishandled, they can file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), depending on the nature of the institution. Additionally, borrowers can seek restitution through legal channels by filing a case in court to rectify the situation and recover any undue payments.</p>
