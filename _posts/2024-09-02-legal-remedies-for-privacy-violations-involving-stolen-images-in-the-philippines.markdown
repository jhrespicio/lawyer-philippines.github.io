<p>Privacy is a fundamental right protected under the Philippine Constitution and various laws, including the Data Privacy Act of 2012. The unauthorized use or distribution of personal images without consent constitutes a violation of privacy and can lead to both civil and criminal liabilities. If an individual's image is stolen and used without their permission, they may file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) or pursue legal action under the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009. This law specifically prohibits the unauthorized recording, copying, or distribution of images or videos that violate an individual's privacy. Victims can seek damages and demand the removal or cessation of the unlawful use of their images. It is advisable for individuals to promptly report such violations to authorities and seek legal advice to protect their rights and privacy.</p>
