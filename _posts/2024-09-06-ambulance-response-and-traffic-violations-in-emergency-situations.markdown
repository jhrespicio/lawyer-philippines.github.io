<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>In urgent situations, is it legally permissible for a barangay ambulance to pass through areas marked with 'No Entry' signs to avoid delays in responding to emergencies? This would significantly cut down on response times.<br><strong>Concerned Barangay Official</strong></p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Republic Act No. 4136, also known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, emergency vehicles such as ambulances are generally allowed to disregard certain traffic rules, including 'No Entry' signs, provided they are responding to an emergency and using their sirens or flashing lights. However, local ordinances and regulations may also apply, so it is important to consult your local government unit for specific rules governing emergency vehicle access in your area. In most cases, traffic enforcers will give way to emergency vehicles, but itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the safety of both the public and the personnel aboard the ambulance is not compromised.</p>
