<p>In the Philippines, the Labor Code stipulates that employees who work on their rest days are entitled to additional compensation. The base rate for work done on a rest day is typically 130% of the employeeâ€™s regular daily rate. If the rest day work falls on a special non-working day or a regular holiday, the compensation increases further. For instance, if an employee works on a rest day that is also a regular holiday, they may be entitled to 200% of their regular rate. Employers must comply with these requirements to ensure that employees are fairly compensated for their work during rest periods. It is crucial for both employers and employees to understand these entitlements to avoid disputes and ensure proper compensation for rest day work.</p>
