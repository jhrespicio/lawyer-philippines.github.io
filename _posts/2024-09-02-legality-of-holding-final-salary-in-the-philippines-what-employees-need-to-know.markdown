<p>In the Philippines, labor laws are designed to protect employees' rights, including the timely payment of wages. Under the Labor Code, employees are entitled to receive their wages in full and on time. Employers are generally not allowed to withhold an employeeâ€™s salary, including the final salary due upon the termination of the employment contract. However, there may be circumstances where deductions are permissible, such as for unpaid loans, damages caused by the employee, or other legal obligations, provided these deductions are authorized by law or the employee has given written consent. If an employer withholds the final salary without a valid reason, the employee has the right to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or pursue legal action for recovery of wages. Employees should be aware of their rights and seek legal advice if they believe their final salary is being unfairly withheld.</p>
