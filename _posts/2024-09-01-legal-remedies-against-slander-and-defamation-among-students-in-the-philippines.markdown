<p>In the Philippines, defamation, which includes slander and libel, is a criminal offense punishable under the Revised Penal Code. Slander refers to oral defamation, where false and malicious statements are made publicly, damaging the reputation of another person. Even students, regardless of age, can be held accountable for such acts if they spread false rumors that harm another's reputation.</p><p>For a defamation case to prosper, the complainant must prove that the statements made were indeed defamatory, false, and uttered with malice. The law recognizes the right of individuals, including students, to protect their reputation against unwarranted attacks.</p><p>If a student spreads a false rumor about another, such as implying an improper relationship, the victim can file a complaint for slander. The process usually begins at the barangay level for mediation and possible settlement. If no resolution is reached, the case may be elevated to the regular courts.</p><p>Given the potential mental and emotional impact of defamatory statements, especially among young individuals, it is advisable for the aggrieved party to seek psychological support. In parallel, they should consult with a legal professional to explore the possibility of filing a case. If proven guilty, the offender may face penalties, including fines and imprisonment, depending on the severity of the defamation.</p><p>It's important to note that in educational settings, schools may also have policies against bullying and harassment, which could include spreading harmful rumors. These policies can serve as additional avenues for addressing such issues internally within the institution.</p>
