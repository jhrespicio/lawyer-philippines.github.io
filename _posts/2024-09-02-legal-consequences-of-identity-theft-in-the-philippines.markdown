<p>Identity theft, including the unauthorized use of someone else's name or identity for fraudulent activities, is a criminal offense in the Philippines under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175). When an individual uses another person's identity, whether through creating a dummy account on social media or for other fraudulent purposes such as incurring debt, it can lead to both criminal and civil liabilities.</p><p>The victim of identity theft can file a complaint with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) for investigation. The perpetrator, if found guilty, may face imprisonment and fines, and the victim may also seek compensation for damages through a civil action. The swift reporting of such incidents is crucial to prevent further harm and to enable authorities to act quickly in tracing and apprehending the offender.</p>
