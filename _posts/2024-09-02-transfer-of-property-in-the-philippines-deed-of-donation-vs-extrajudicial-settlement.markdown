<p>Transferring property in the Philippines, particularly from one family member to another, can be done through several legal instruments, with the most common being a Deed of Donation and an Extrajudicial Settlement. A Deed of Donation is a legal document wherein a donor voluntarily transfers property ownership to a donee without any monetary consideration. This is typically used when the transferor is still alive and wishes to give the property as a gift. The Deed of Donation must be notarized and registered with the Registry of Deeds to effect the transfer of title. However, it is subject to donor's tax, which varies depending on the relationship between the donor and the donee.</p><p>On the other hand, an Extrajudicial Settlement is used when the transfer of property occurs after the death of the owner, particularly when the deceased did not leave a will (intestate succession). The heirs agree on how to distribute the property among themselves. This process requires the filing of an extrajudicial settlement agreement, which must be notarized, published in a newspaper of general circulation, and registered with the Registry of Deeds. The estate is also subject to estate tax, which must be settled before the transfer of title can occur.</p><p>Both methods of property transfer have their respective legal requirements and tax implications. Choosing between them depends on the specific circumstances, such as whether the transferor is alive or deceased, and the relationship between the parties involved.</p>
