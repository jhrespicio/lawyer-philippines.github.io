<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am a person with a disability (PWD) earning a gross income of P59,000. However, my net take-home pay during the month I was declared a PWD is only P5,800. Am I still entitled to a tax exemption?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons (Republic Act No. 7277), PWDs are entitled to tax exemptions and benefits. However, the entitlement to these exemptions is contingent on certain income thresholds. For individuals earning above P57,000 gross income annually, the law does not typically grant a tax exemption. The law considers the gross income rather than the net take-home pay when determining eligibility for tax exemptions. Given that your gross income exceeds the P57,000 threshold, you would not be eligible for the tax exemption under current regulations, despite your lower net take-home pay.</p>
