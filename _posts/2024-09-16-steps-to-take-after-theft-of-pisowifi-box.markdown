<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> My Pisowifi box was stolen, and it cost around Php14,000. The thief also took coins amounting to Php800-1,200 and caused damage worth almost Php2,000. What should I do if the thief is caught?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> If the person responsible for the theft is caught, you can file a criminal case for theft under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. Theft is considered a crime against property, and the value of the stolen items will determine the penalties. You should report the incident to the police immediately and provide all necessary evidence, such as receipts, photos, or CCTV footage, to support your case. Once the criminal is apprehended, you can also file for damages or restitution in civil court to recover the cost of your stolen and damaged property.</p>
