<p>In the Philippines, the standard practice for resignation is to provide a 30-day notice period, as stipulated in the Labor Code. However, if no employment contract specifies a notice period, the default rule still applies. The 30-day notice allows the employer time to find a replacement and ensures a smooth transition. Some employers may enforce a longer notice period, such as 60 or 90 days, based on company policy, but this is typically valid only if agreed upon by both parties in an employment contract. In the absence of such an agreement, employees may negotiate the notice period or choose to leave after the 30-day period. Employers cannot compel an employee to serve a longer notice period without a mutual agreement.</p>
