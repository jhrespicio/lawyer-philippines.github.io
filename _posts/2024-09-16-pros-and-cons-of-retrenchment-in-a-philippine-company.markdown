<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Our company is considering retrenchment due to financial difficulties. Can you explain the legal process for retrenchment and what the pros and cons are for our company if we proceed with it? We want to ensure we follow the law and minimize risks.<br><br><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Retrenchment is a legal way for a company to reduce its workforce due to financial difficulties or operational downsizing. Under Philippine labor law, particularly Article 298 of the Labor Code, retrenchment is allowed if there is a legitimate business necessity. The company must provide at least one month’s notice to the affected employees and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Affected employees are entitled to separation pay equivalent to one month’s salary or half a month’s salary for every year of service, whichever is higher.<br>Pros of retrenchment include immediate cost savings for the company and a more sustainable workforce size. However, the cons include the risk of legal challenges from employees who may contest the retrenchment as being unjust or unnecessary. There is also the potential for a negative impact on employee morale and public relations. It's crucial to ensure that all steps in the retrenchment process are followed meticulously to avoid labor disputes and penalties.</p>
