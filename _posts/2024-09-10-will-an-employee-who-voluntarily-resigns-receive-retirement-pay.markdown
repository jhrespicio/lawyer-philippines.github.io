<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>If an employee voluntarily resigns after working for almost 24 years with a company, will he still be entitled to receive retirement benefits? Thank you for your guidance.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under the Philippine Labor Code, an employee is entitled to retirement pay upon reaching the retirement age of 60 (optional) or 65 (mandatory), provided they have served at least five years with the company. However, if an employee voluntarily resigns before reaching the retirement age, the law generally does not require the employer to provide retirement benefits, unless otherwise stated in a company policy or a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Some companies may offer early retirement packages, but this is discretionary and subject to the company's internal policies. It would be advisable to review the employment contract or consult with the human resources department to check if any such provisions are applicable in this case.</p>
