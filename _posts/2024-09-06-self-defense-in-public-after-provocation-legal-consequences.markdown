<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was constantly provoked and insulted in public, which led me to lose control and hit the person with a billiard cue. Can this be considered self-defense?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine law, self-defense is a valid legal defense, but it must meet specific conditions. The Revised Penal Code requires unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity to prevent or repel such aggression, and lack of sufficient provocation on your part. In your situation, hitting the person with a billiard cue after being verbally provoked may not meet the criteria for self-defense since physical force might be seen as excessive or disproportionate to the verbal provocation. Instead, this may be viewed as retaliation rather than self-defense. You may face criminal liability for the act of hitting the person. It is important to consult with a lawyer to assess the specific circumstances of your case and to explore potential defenses, such as mitigating factors like emotional distress.</p>
