<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My spouse is facing a physical injury case. The person he allegedly hurt was the first to attack my spouse’s sibling. What are our options in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In cases of physical injury, self-defense can be a valid legal defense if it can be proven that your spouse only acted to protect another person from harm. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines allows for the justifying circumstance of self-defense, which must meet certain conditions, including unlawful aggression from the other party and reasonable force used to repel the attack. Your spouse should gather evidence to support this claim, such as eyewitness testimonies, medical records, or any video footage of the incident. It is crucial to engage a lawyer to assess the situation thoroughly and guide you through the legal proceedings. Your lawyer can help determine whether a counter-charge for the initial aggressor’s actions is appropriate.</p>
