<p>In the Philippines, employees who resign are entitled to receive their final pay, which typically includes unpaid wages, pro-rated 13th-month pay, unused vacation leaves, and other earned benefits. According to the Labor Code of the Philippines, employers are required to release the final pay within a reasonable period, usually within 30 days after the employee's last working day.</p><p>If an employer fails to release the final pay within the stipulated time, the former employee can take several steps to resolve the issue. Initially, the employee should follow up with the companyâ€™s Human Resources department in writing, detailing the delay and requesting the immediate release of the final pay.</p><p>If the company does not respond or refuses to release the payment, the employee can file a formal complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). DOLE provides a mechanism for dispute resolution and can mediate between the employee and the employer to ensure that the final pay is released.</p><p>For overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who have resigned and are no longer in the Philippines, the process may be more complex. However, they can still seek assistance from DOLE, either by contacting the Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) in their current location or by filing a complaint online through DOLE's official website.</p><p>Legal action is also an option if the employer continues to withhold the final pay without valid reason. However, this should be considered as a last resort, given the potential costs and time involved. Seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in labor law is recommended to explore this option.</p>
