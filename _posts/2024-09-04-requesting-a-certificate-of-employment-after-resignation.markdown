<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I recently resigned from my job after working for a year with my previous employer. However, despite my requests, the company has not provided me with a Certificate of Employment (COE), and the process has been very difficult. Am I entitled to receive this document, and what should I do if they refuse to provide it?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor law, a Certificate of Employment (COE) must be issued upon request by an employee. The COE is a document stating the employeeâ€™s duration of employment and the position held. Employers are obligated to provide this within a reasonable time after the request is made. If your employer refuses to issue the COE, you may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to enforce your right. It is advisable to send a formal written request first to create a documented paper trail before escalating the matter to legal authorities.</p>
