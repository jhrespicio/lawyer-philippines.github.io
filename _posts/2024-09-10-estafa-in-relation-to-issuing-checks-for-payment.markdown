<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Someone borrowed money and promised to issue a check as payment. However, when the agreed day came, they did not give the check, even though they had signed an agreement that they would return the collateral check. Can this be considered estafa?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, estafa is a form of fraud punishable under the Revised Penal Code. If a person borrows money and promises to issue a check as payment but later fails to deliver on that promise, they may be liable for estafa, especially if the intent to defraud can be proven. The key element in estafa is deceit, and failing to provide the promised check after making a commitment can be considered an act of deception. Additionally, if the borrower knowingly did not have sufficient funds or had no intention of issuing the check, this strengthens the case for estafa. The aggrieved party may file a criminal complaint, but it is important to consult with a lawyer to assess the details and determine the best legal course of action.</p>
