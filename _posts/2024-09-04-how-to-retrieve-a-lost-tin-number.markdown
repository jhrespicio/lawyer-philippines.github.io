<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I lost my Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and I cannot remember it. How can I retrieve it?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> If you have forgotten your TIN, there are several ways to retrieve it. First, you can visit the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) office where you originally registered. Bring valid identification such as a government-issued ID, and the BIR personnel will assist you in retrieving your TIN. Alternatively, you can check if you have any official documents, such as tax returns or certificates, that may contain your TIN. You may also use the BIR's e-Services for registered users. If these options are not available, contacting the BIR through their hotline or email can help facilitate the retrieval process.</p>
