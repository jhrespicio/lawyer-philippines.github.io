<p>In the Philippines, capital gains tax is a significant consideration in real estate transactions. This tax is imposed on the profit gained from the sale or exchange of capital assets, such as real property. According to the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), the seller is generally responsible for paying the capital gains tax.</p><p>However, it is not uncommon for the buyer and seller to negotiate who will bear the tax burden. While the law stipulates that the seller should pay, the parties can agree for the buyer to shoulder the cost as part of the transaction terms. This agreement should be clearly stated in the deed of sale or contract to avoid future disputes.</p><p>The capital gains tax rate for real estate transactions in the Philippines is currently 6% of the gross selling price or the fair market value of the property, whichever is higher. This tax must be paid within 30 days from the date of sale, exchange, or transfer of the property. Failure to do so can result in penalties, surcharges, and interest charges imposed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).</p><p>It is important for both buyers and sellers to understand their tax obligations and to ensure that all taxes are paid on time to avoid legal complications. Consulting with a tax advisor or legal professional can provide additional guidance and ensure that all aspects of the transaction comply with Philippine tax laws.</p>
