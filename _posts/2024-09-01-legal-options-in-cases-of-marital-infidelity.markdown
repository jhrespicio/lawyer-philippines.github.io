<p>Discovering that your spouse has fathered or mothered a child with another person can be a traumatic experience. In the Philippines, if you are legally married and have discovered that your spouse has a child with someone else, you may consider filing a case for concubinage or adultery, depending on the circumstances.</p><p>Concubinage is committed by a husband who cohabitates with a mistress in a conjugal dwelling or in any other place. Adultery, on the other hand, is committed by a wife who has sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband. Both offenses are punishable under the Revised Penal Code.</p><p>Aside from criminal charges, you may also consider filing for legal separation or annulment of marriage if you wish to dissolve your marital union. Consultation with a legal professional is crucial to determine the best course of action based on the specific details of your situation.</p>
