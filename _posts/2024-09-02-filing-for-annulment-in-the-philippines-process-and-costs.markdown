<p>Annulment is a legal procedure in the Philippines that declares a marriage null and void as if it never existed. This is different from divorce, which dissolves a valid marriage. In the Philippines, where divorce is not legal (except for Muslims under certain conditions), annulment is the primary legal recourse for individuals seeking to end their marriage.</p><p>To file for an annulment, the petitioner must have valid grounds as specified under the Family Code of the Philippines. These grounds include psychological incapacity, lack of parental consent (if either party was 18 to 21 years old at the time of marriage), fraud, force, intimidation, undue influence, impotence, sexually transmitted diseases, and others.</p><p>The process begins with the filing of a petition in the Regional Trial Court (Family Court) of the province or city where the petitioner or respondent resides. The petition must clearly state the grounds for annulment, supported by evidence such as testimonies, medical records, or psychological evaluations. The respondent will then be given the opportunity to contest the petition.</p><p>Once the court accepts the petition, the case will proceed through pre-trial and trial stages, where evidence is presented and witnesses may be called. If the court finds sufficient grounds, it will issue a decision declaring the marriage void. The entire process can be lengthy and may take several years to conclude.</p><p>The cost of filing for annulment varies and can be significant. Expenses may include attorneyâ€™s fees, court fees, and other related costs such as psychological assessments and document processing. Due to the complexity and cost of the process, it is advisable to seek the assistance of an experienced family law attorney to guide you through the legal proceedings and improve the chances of a favorable outcome.</p>
