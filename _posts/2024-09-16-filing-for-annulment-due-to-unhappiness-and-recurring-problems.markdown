<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If my spouse and I are no longer happy with each other, and it feels like problems keep arising easily because of that, can we file for annulment in the Philippines?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, annulment is a legal process that declares a marriage null and void, as if it never took place. However, annulment cannot be based simply on unhappiness or recurring problems between spouses. The grounds for annulment are specific and must exist at the time of the marriage. These grounds include lack of parental consent (for those who married below 21 years old), mental illness, fraud, consent obtained through force, intimidation, or undue influence, impotence, or if one of the spouses was afflicted with a sexually transmitted disease at the time of marriage. If none of these apply, the couple may explore legal separation or file for nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.</p>
