<p>In the Philippines, terminal leave refers to the accumulated leave credits of a government employee that are paid out as a lump sum upon retirement, resignation, or separation from service. This benefit is granted under various civil service laws and is applicable to all regular government employees who have accumulated unused leave credits over their years of service.</p><p>Terminal leave benefits are calculated based on the employee’s highest salary received during their tenure, and the payout is exempt from taxes, making it a significant financial benefit for retiring or resigning employees. The formula typically used is the daily salary rate multiplied by the number of accumulated leave days. The daily salary rate is computed by dividing the monthly salary by the number of working days in a month.</p><p>To apply for terminal leave, the employee must submit a formal request to the head of their agency or office, accompanied by a certification of accumulated leave credits from the human resources department. The request should be made prior to the employee’s last day of service, although in practice, it can also be processed after separation. However, the processing of terminal leave benefits may take some time due to the necessary approvals and computations involved.</p><p>It is important for government employees to regularly monitor their leave credits and ensure that any discrepancies are addressed well before retirement or resignation. Additionally, employees who have availed of terminal leave are no longer entitled to earn leave credits during the period covered by the terminal leave. This benefit serves as a form of financial security for government employees as they transition out of public service.</p>
