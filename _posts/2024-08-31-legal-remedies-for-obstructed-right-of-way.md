### Simplified Question:
Can a landowner's heirs be sued for blocking a right of way that has long been used by the public, even if the original documentation is missing?

### Understanding the Right of Way in the Philippines

In the Philippines, a "right of way" is a legal concept that allows a person to pass through another person's land. This right is typically granted through an agreement between the landowner and the individual who needs access, and it may also be acquired through prescription or legal necessity under certain conditions.

### Legal Basis for Right of Way

Under the Civil Code of the Philippines, a right of way may be constituted either by law (legal easement) or by voluntary agreement between the parties involved. If a right of way has been established and used continuously for a significant period, it may become legally enforceable, even if the original documentation is missing. However, the existence of the right of way must be proven, often through evidence such as witness testimony, historical use, or other documentation.

### Remedies for Obstruction of Right of Way

If a right of way is obstructed, the affected parties may have legal recourse against the person responsible for the obstruction. The remedies available include:

1. **Action for the Recognition of the Right of Way**: The affected party can file a case to have the court recognize the existence of the right of way. This is essential if the heirs of the original landowner deny the right of way's existence or validity.

2. **Action for Removal of Obstruction**: If the right of way is recognized, the affected party may demand the removal of any obstruction that prevents them from using the pathway. This could involve filing a petition in court for the issuance of a mandatory injunction to compel the removal of the barrier.

3. **Damages**: If the obstruction of the right of way has caused harm or inconvenience, the affected party may also seek compensation for damages. This could cover additional expenses incurred due to the longer route, lost income, or any other quantifiable harm.

### The Importance of Evidence

In any legal action regarding a right of way, the burden of proof lies with the party claiming the right. Therefore, it is crucial to gather evidence that supports the existence and continued use of the right of way. This evidence could include:

- Testimonies from long-term residents or neighbors who can attest to the historical use of the pathway.
- Old maps, plans, or other documents that show the pathway's existence.
- Photographs or other physical evidence of the pathway.

### Conclusion

While the absence of original documentation can complicate the enforcement of a right of way, it does not necessarily invalidate the right itself. If the right of way has been in use for a long time and can be proven through other means, affected parties have legal remedies to seek recognition of the right and removal of any obstructions. Consulting with a legal professional who specializes in property law is advisable to navigate the complexities of such cases.
