<p>In the Philippines, probationary employment is typically set for a period of six months, during which both the employer and employee assess the suitability of the employment relationship. If the probationary period ends without the employee being formally evaluated or regularized, and the employee continues to work, they are deemed a regular employee under the law. This entitles them to all the rights and benefits of regular employees, including security of tenure.</p><p>As a regular employee, the individual is required to submit a formal resignation if they intend to leave the company, following the standard notice period of 30 days, unless a shorter period is mutually agreed upon with the employer. The resignation should be in writing and should clearly state the effective date to avoid any legal disputes.</p><p>If no work evaluation was conducted during the probationary period, the employee might have grounds to question the fairness of their probation and seek remedies through the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Employers are obligated to provide feedback and evaluation during the probationary period to justify any decision related to the employee's status.</p><p>In summary, the failure to conduct an evaluation does not absolve the employee from the requirement to tender a resignation after the probationary period has ended, as the law views the continuation of work beyond this period as regular employment.</p>
