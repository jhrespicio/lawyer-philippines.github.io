<p>In the Philippines, the entitlement to overtime pay on rest days is governed by the Labor Code. Generally, employees who work on their scheduled rest day are entitled to an additional premium pay on top of their regular wage. However, if an employee incurs absences during the workweek, the employer may set policies that could affect the employee's eligibility for rest day overtime. For example, if the absences are unauthorized or unexcused, the employer might enforce a policy that disqualifies the employee from receiving overtime pay for work on a rest day during that same week. It is important for both employers and employees to refer to the company's internal policies, collective bargaining agreements, or employment contracts, which may specify conditions under which rest day overtime pay is granted or denied. Employees should ensure that they are aware of these policies to avoid misunderstandings regarding their compensation.</p>
