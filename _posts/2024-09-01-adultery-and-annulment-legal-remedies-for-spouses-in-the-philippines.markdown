<p>Adultery is a criminal offense in the Philippines, punishable under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code. It occurs when a married woman engages in sexual relations with a man other than her husband. If a husband catches his wife committing adultery, he may file a criminal case against her and her lover. Upon conviction, both the wife and her paramour may be imprisoned.</p><p>In addition to the criminal case for adultery, the husband may also seek an annulment of marriage under certain conditions. Annulment is a legal remedy that declares a marriage null and void from the beginning. However, adultery alone is not a ground for annulment in the Philippines. The grounds for annulment are specifically enumerated under Article 45 of the Family Code, including lack of parental consent, psychological incapacity, and fraud.</p><p>If the husband wishes to pursue an annulment, he must establish one of the legal grounds for annulment. Psychological incapacity, for instance, may be claimed if the wife is found to be mentally or emotionally incapable of fulfilling the essential obligations of marriage. This ground requires evidence of a psychological disorder that existed at the time of the marriage and is severe enough to render the wife incapable of performing marital duties.</p><p>The process of annulment involves filing a petition with the Family Court, presenting evidence, and attending hearings. The court will evaluate the evidence and determine whether the marriage should be annulled. If the annulment is granted, the marriage is declared void, and both parties are free to remarry.</p><p>It is essential for individuals considering annulment to seek legal advice and representation. Annulment cases can be complex and emotionally challenging, and the outcome depends on the evidence presented and the court&#39;s discretion.</p><p>In summary, while adultery can lead to criminal prosecution, it does not automatically result in annulment. Understanding the legal remedies available and the grounds for annulment is crucial for those seeking to dissolve their marriage due to marital infidelity.</p>
