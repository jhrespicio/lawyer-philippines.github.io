<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I am a regular employee at a company contracted by SkyCable. Due to low productivity, SkyCable instructed my employer not to let me work anymore. Now, my employer is asking me to sign an end of contract document on Monday. I have been with my employer for five years. Is it legal for them to terminate me due to low productivity?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, regular employees are entitled to security of tenure, meaning they cannot be terminated without just or authorized cause and due process. Low productivity may be considered a ground for termination, but it must be sufficiently proven and should go through the proper procedures. The employer must give you a notice specifying the reasons for your termination, and you must be given an opportunity to respond. If these procedures are not followed, the termination could be deemed illegal, and you may have grounds to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for illegal dismissal.</p>
