<p>In the Philippines, the issue of liability when a check is dishonored, particularly due to being drawn from a closed account, is a serious matter governed by the law. Under Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, commonly known as the Bouncing Checks Law, the drawer or issuer of a check that is dishonored for insufficiency of funds or for being drawn on a closed account may be held criminally liable. This law aims to deter individuals from issuing checks without ensuring that there are sufficient funds in the account at the time of issuance. The liability of the issuer arises regardless of whether the payee deposited the check to their own account or to someone else's account. The key element is that the check was issued by the drawer and was subsequently dishonored due to the account being closed. The drawer may face penalties including fines or imprisonment depending on the circumstances of the case. It is crucial for individuals and businesses to be diligent in ensuring that checks issued are backed by adequate funds to avoid legal consequences.</p>
