<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am a seafarer who signed a contract with a manning agency three months ago. However, I have not yet been deployed or given any updates about when I will board my assigned vessel. I could have joined another agency in this time. Does my agency have any legal liability for this delay?<br><strong>Frustrated Seafarer</strong></p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The Philippines is governed by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Standard Employment Contract for Seafarers. Once a seafarer signs a contract, the manning agency is responsible for deploying them within a reasonable period, as agreed in the contract or as may be customary in the industry. A delay without valid reason could be considered a breach of contract. You may raise this concern with the POEA or seek legal recourse through the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The agency may be held liable for lost wages or any other damages suffered due to the delay, especially if it causes you to miss other employment opportunities.</p>
