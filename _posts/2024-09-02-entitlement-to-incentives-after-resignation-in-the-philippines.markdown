<p>In the Philippines, employees who consistently meet or exceed their target quotas are often entitled to incentives as part of their compensation package. However, when an employee decides to resign, questions may arise regarding the entitlement to these earned incentives. Generally, an employee is entitled to receive incentives earned before the resignation, provided that these incentives are not contingent upon future performance or continued employment. The terms of these incentives are usually outlined in the employment contract or company policy. It is advisable for resigning employees to review their contracts and discuss with their employer or HR department to clarify any entitlements. If the company refuses to release the earned incentives, the employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to seek legal recourse. It is important to note that any claims should be made within the prescriptive period provided by law to avoid forfeiture of rights.</p>
