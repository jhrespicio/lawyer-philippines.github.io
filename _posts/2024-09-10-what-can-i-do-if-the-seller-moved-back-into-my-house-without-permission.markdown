<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I bought a house in 2009, but my wife refused to live there, so I left it empty. Recently, I discovered that the seller, who kept a key, moved back into the house with her husband without my permission. What legal steps can I take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>As the rightful owner of the property, you have the legal right to possess and control who stays in the house. If the seller moved back in without your consent, they are unlawfully occupying the property. You may file an ejectment case (also known as unlawful detainer or forcible entry) under the Rules of Court to legally remove them from the premises. The seller had no legal right to retain the key after the sale of the property, and their actions may also constitute a breach of contract. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to initiate legal proceedings and secure your rights over the property.</p>
