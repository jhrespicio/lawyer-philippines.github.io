<p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is responsible for handling criminal records and other legal documentation in the Philippines. If you need to check whether you have a record with the NBI, you can do so through several methods. The most common way is to apply for an NBI Clearance, a document that certifies whether you have any criminal record. You can apply for this clearance online through the NBI's official website, where you will need to fill out personal information and schedule an appointment for biometric data capture. After your application, the NBI will conduct a background check. If you have a record, this will be reflected in your clearance, typically marked as 'hit,' indicating that further verification or clearance processes may be required. In addition to online checks, you can also visit an NBI branch to inquire about your status directly. Ensure you have the necessary identification documents when making such inquiries. Tracking your NBI record is essential for various legal and employment processes in the Philippines.</p>
