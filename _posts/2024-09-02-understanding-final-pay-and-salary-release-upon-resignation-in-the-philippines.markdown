<p>When an employee resigns in the Philippines, the final pay refers to the total amount owed to the employee by the employer at the end of the employment. This includes unpaid salaries, pro-rated 13th-month pay, unused leave credits, and other benefits. An employee who resigns and agrees to render a 30-day notice period is entitled to receive their salary for the days worked within that period. The salary due for the days worked before the final pay, such as for the January 30 and February 15 payroll, is typically released as per the usual payroll schedule and is separate from the final pay. The final pay is usually processed and released after the employee has completed their notice period and cleared any accountabilities with the company. Employers are legally required to provide the final pay within a reasonable time, usually within 30 days after the end of employment, although delays can occur depending on company policy and the fulfillment of clearance procedures.</p>
