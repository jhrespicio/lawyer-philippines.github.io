<p>In the Philippines, grave threats are criminal acts defined under Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code. A person commits grave threats when they threaten another with a crime or harm that would cause alarm or fear. The law distinguishes between grave threats (which involve harm or a crime that is serious in nature) and light threats (which involve lesser harm or crime).</p><p>If someone points a gun at another person, this can be classified as a grave threat, given the serious nature of the threat. Under the law, such an incident can be brought directly to the fiscal's office (now more commonly referred to as the prosecutor's office) for preliminary investigation. This step is crucial because grave threats are considered a criminal offense, and the fiscal is responsible for determining whether there is probable cause to proceed with filing a case in court.</p><p>It is not necessary to go through barangay conciliation for grave threats because this crime falls under the exceptions to the Katarungang Pambarangay Law, which requires barangay conciliation for certain disputes before they can be elevated to the courts. Immediate legal action can be taken due to the criminal nature of the offense.</p>
