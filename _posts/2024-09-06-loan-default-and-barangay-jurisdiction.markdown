<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I failed to pay a loan, and the lender is threatening to take the issue to the barangay. What is the proper jurisdiction of the barangay for such matters?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, small claims and disputes over unpaid debts, including loan defaults, may first be brought before the Barangay Justice System under the Katarungang Pambarangay Law. The barangay serves as a local mediation platform for resolving disputes without the need to go directly to court. The barangay captain or other designated officials will attempt to mediate between both parties and encourage an amicable settlement. If mediation fails, a certificate to file action will be issued, allowing the lender to escalate the matter to the appropriate court. The barangayâ€™s jurisdiction covers minor civil disputes between individuals residing within the same barangay or nearby areas.</p>
