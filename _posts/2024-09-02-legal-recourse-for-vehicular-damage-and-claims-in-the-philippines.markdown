<p>In the event of a vehicular accident in the Philippines, the injured party has the right to seek compensation for damages. If the incident has been reported to the barangay and the at-fault party refuses to pay for the damages, the injured party may file a formal complaint in court. Legal action can be pursued if the barangay settlement process fails to resolve the issue. The success of such a claim in court will depend on the evidence presented, including witness statements, photographs of the damage, and police reports. The injured party must prove that the other party was negligent or at fault for the accident. Should the court find in favor of the injured party, they may be awarded damages covering repair costs, medical expenses, and other related losses. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of the case before proceeding with litigation.</p>
