<p>Debt collection practices in the Philippines are regulated by various laws, including the Consumer Act and the Revised Penal Code. While creditors have the right to collect debts, they must do so within the bounds of the law. Harassment, threats, or involving barangay officials in a manner that intimidates or coerces the debtor can be considered unlawful. Debtors who experience such actions can file complaints with the appropriate authorities, such as the National Privacy Commission or the Department of Trade and Industry, or pursue legal action for harassment or unjust vexation.</p>
