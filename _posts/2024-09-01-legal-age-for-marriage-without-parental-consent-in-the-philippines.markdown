<p>In the Philippines, the legal age for marriage without the need for parental consent or advice is set by the Family Code of the Philippines. Under Article 5 of the Family Code, males and females who are at least 18 years old but under 21 years old may contract marriage with the consent of their parents. However, those aged 21 to 25 need only to seek parental advice. Importantly, once an individual reaches the age of 25, they are legally allowed to marry without needing either parental consent or advice. Therefore, 25-year-old individuals can marry without an affidavit of parental advice, while those who are 21 to 24 years old still require such advice.</p>
