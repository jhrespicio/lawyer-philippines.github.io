<p>Forgery is a serious criminal offense under Philippine law, punishable by imprisonment and fines. It involves the falsification of a document or signature with the intent to deceive or defraud another party. In cases where a forgery results in the illegal acquisition or transfer of property, the penalties may be even more severe.</p><p>The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, particularly Articles 171 and 172, classifies forgery and falsification as crimes against public trust. This means that the act not only harms the individual victim but also undermines the integrity of public documents and the legal system.</p><p>When forgery involves the signature of a deceased person, as in the context of estate or property division, the crime takes on an additional layer of gravity. The act could invalidate the legal processes related to the distribution of the deceased's estate and could lead to prolonged litigation. Those found guilty of forgery may face imprisonment, restitution, and civil liabilities, including the return of wrongfully acquired properties.</p><p>Victims of forgery are advised to file a criminal complaint with the appropriate authorities, providing evidence such as the forged document and expert testimony from a handwriting expert if necessary. Legal remedies are available to nullify fraudulent transactions and restore the rightful ownership of properties.</p>
