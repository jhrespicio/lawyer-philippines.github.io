<p>Dear Attorney,</p><p>I requested a Certificate of Employment (COE) from my previous employer two weeks ago, but they seem to be delaying or avoiding providing it. What steps can I take to secure this document?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor laws, employers are obligated to provide a Certificate of Employment to a former employee upon request. If your employer continues to delay, you can formally submit a written request or follow up with the company's HR department. If this does not resolve the issue, you may consider lodging a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to enforce your right to receive the COE. The law provides clear protection for employees in this regard, and DOLE can help facilitate the release of the document.</p>
