<p>In the Philippines, legal fees such as acceptance and appearance fees are determined by the agreement between the lawyer and the client. Acceptance fees are typically the initial payment made to a lawyer for taking on a case, while appearance fees are payments made for each court appearance or hearing attended by the lawyer on behalf of the client.</p><p>These fees can vary widely depending on the complexity of the case, the experience of the lawyer, and other factors. It is essential for clients to discuss and agree on the fee structure with their lawyer before the case proceeds to ensure transparency and avoid misunderstandings.</p><p>Clients should also be aware that lawyers are bound by the Code of Professional Responsibility, which requires them to charge fees that are fair, reasonable, and commensurate with the services rendered.</p>
