<p>In the Philippines, if someone owes you money and refuses to pay, one of the first steps you can take is to file a complaint with the Barangay. The Barangay serves as the first level of dispute resolution for minor cases, including unpaid debts. To file a complaint, visit the Barangay Hall where the debtor resides and submit a written complaint detailing the nature of the debt and the amount owed. The Barangay will schedule a mediation session between you and the debtor, where both parties can present their sides. The goal is to reach an amicable settlement. If mediation fails, the Barangay may issue a Certification to File Action, allowing you to bring the case to court. This process is designed to provide a cost-effective and accessible means of resolving disputes at the community level.</p>
