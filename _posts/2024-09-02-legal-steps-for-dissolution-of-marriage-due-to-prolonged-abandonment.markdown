<p>In the Philippines, marriage is a legally binding contract that can only be dissolved through specific legal grounds. If a spouse has been abandoned for an extended period, as in cases where there has been no communication or support for many years, the abandoned spouse may seek to dissolve the marriage. One legal avenue is filing for annulment, where psychological incapacity (Article 36 of the Family Code) could be cited as a ground if it can be proven that the spouse was unable to fulfill marital obligations due to a psychological condition. Another option may be seeking a declaration of presumptive death under Article 41 of the Family Code if the absent spouse has been missing for four consecutive years or two years if there is danger of death. This allows the abandoned spouse to remarry legally. Consulting with a family law attorney is crucial to determine the appropriate course of action based on the specifics of the case.</p>
