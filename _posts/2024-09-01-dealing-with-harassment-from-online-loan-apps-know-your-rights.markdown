<p>In the Philippines, borrowers often face harassment from online loan apps, especially when payment deadlines approach. This harassment can include persistent calls, text messages, and even threats. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has issued guidelines aimed at protecting consumers from such abusive practices. Under these guidelines, lending companies are prohibited from using threats, violence, or other forms of harassment in collecting debts. Borrowers who experience such treatment can file complaints with the BSP or the National Privacy Commission if their personal data is misused. It's crucial to document all instances of harassment and seek legal assistance if necessary.</p>
