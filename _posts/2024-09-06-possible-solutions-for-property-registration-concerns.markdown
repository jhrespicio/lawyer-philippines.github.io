<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am seeking advice regarding a property that is still registered under my name. Despite some recent developments, I want to understand what possible legal actions I can take and whether I have a strong case given that the property remains in my name. What are my options, and how might the court view my case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, property registration under your name provides a prima facie presumption of ownership. This means the law recognizes you as the rightful owner unless proven otherwise. If a dispute arises, maintaining the registration in your name is crucial. You may file for quieting of title if your ownership is challenged. Additionally, if others are claiming rights to the property without valid legal documents, you can seek judicial or extrajudicial measures to assert your ownership. To strengthen your case, ensure that all necessary property tax payments are up to date and that the title has no encumbrances. Consulting with a real estate lawyer can help map out specific strategies to protect your property rights.</p>
