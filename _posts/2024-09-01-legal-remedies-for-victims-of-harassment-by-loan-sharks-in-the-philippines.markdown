<p>In the Philippines, loan sharks, or individuals and entities that offer unsecured loans at exorbitant interest rates, often resort to unethical and illegal tactics to collect debts. These tactics may include harassment, threats, and public disclosure of a debtor’s personal information, all of which are violations of the debtor’s rights under Philippine law.</p><p>Victims of harassment by loan sharks have several legal remedies available. First, under Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012, it is illegal for creditors to disclose personal information without the consent of the data subject. If a loan shark threatens to make a debtor’s personal details public, the debtor can file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) for violation of their data privacy rights.</p><p>Moreover, harassment, including threats and intimidation, can constitute grave coercion or unjust vexation under the Revised Penal Code. Victims can file a criminal complaint with the police or the prosecutor’s office against the loan shark. If the harassment is causing severe emotional distress or mental anguish, the victim may also seek damages through a civil suit for moral damages.</p><p>Given the complexity of these issues, and the potential for escalation, it is advisable for victims to seek legal assistance from a qualified attorney. Legal aid organizations may also provide support to individuals who cannot afford private counsel, ensuring that they have access to justice despite their financial situation.</p>
