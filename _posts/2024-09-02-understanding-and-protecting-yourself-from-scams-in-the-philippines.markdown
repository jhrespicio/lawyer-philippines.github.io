<p>Scams are prevalent in the Philippines, with scammers employing various tactics to deceive individuals and steal money or personal information. Common scams include phishing, online shopping fraud, investment scams, and text scams, among others. To protect yourself, it is essential to be vigilant and skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true. Always verify the legitimacy of any transaction or communication, especially those involving money. Do not share personal or financial information with unknown parties. If you suspect that you have been scammed, report the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group. It is also advisable to seek legal advice to explore possible remedies, such as filing a case for estafa or seeking compensation through civil action.</p>
