<p>Estafa, or swindling, is a criminal offense under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. It involves defrauding another person or entity, usually by abusing trust or confidence. Estafa can occur in various forms, such as through deceit, misappropriation, or the issuance of bad checks. However, one common scenario involves borrowing money without the intention of repaying it.</p><p>If you fail to repay a loan, particularly from a lending institution or an individual, and the lender believes that you never intended to repay the debt, they may file a case of estafa against you. However, not all instances of non-payment automatically result in estafa. The prosecution must prove that deceit was present from the beginning, meaning you borrowed the money without the intent to repay it.</p><p>In cases where the lender threatens to file estafa charges, it is crucial to seek legal advice immediately. You may be able to negotiate with the lender to settle the debt and avoid criminal charges. If a case is filed, and you are summoned by the barangay or the court, it is essential to attend all hearings and present your defense. Failure to do so could result in a warrant for your arrest and further legal complications.</p><p>Being charged with estafa is a serious matter, and the penalties can include imprisonment and significant fines. It is vital to understand your rights and obligations under the law and to act swiftly to resolve any disputes before they escalate into criminal charges.</p>
