<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>If my motion for reconsideration is denied in a homicide case, can I still appeal the decision while being out on bail during the pending appeal?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If your motion for reconsideration is denied, you generally still have the right to appeal the decision to a higher court. In the Philippine legal system, appealing a decision is a right granted to the accused, especially in serious cases like homicide. However, whether you can remain out on bail during the appeal depends on several factors, including the specifics of the case, the discretion of the court, and whether the offense is bailable. Typically, if you were granted bail during the trial, you may remain on bail during the appeal unless the court finds compelling reasons to revoke it, such as flight risk or commission of another offense. It is crucial to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications and ensure all necessary legal steps are followed.</p>
