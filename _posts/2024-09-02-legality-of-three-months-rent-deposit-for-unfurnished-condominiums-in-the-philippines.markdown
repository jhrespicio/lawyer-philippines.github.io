<p>In the Philippines, the legality of collecting a three-month rent deposit for unfurnished condominium units is a matter governed by the terms of the lease agreement and relevant laws. Under Republic Act No. 9653, also known as the Rent Control Act of 2009, landlords are allowed to collect a maximum of one month’s advance rent and a two-month deposit at the start of the lease. However, the law primarily covers residential units with rent not exceeding a specific amount. For units that fall outside this threshold, the landlord and tenant have more flexibility to negotiate the terms of the security deposit. It is crucial for tenants to carefully review their lease agreements and ensure that the terms regarding deposits are clear and fair. Any agreement on deposits should ideally be documented in writing to prevent disputes. While a three-month deposit may be seen as a significant amount, it is not inherently illegal if both parties agree to it, provided that it does not violate the Rent Control Act’s provisions.</p>
