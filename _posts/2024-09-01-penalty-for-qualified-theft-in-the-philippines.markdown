<p>Qualified theft in the Philippines is a serious crime punishable under Article 310 in relation to Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code. The penalty for qualified theft depends on the value of the property stolen, with higher amounts resulting in more severe penalties. For an amount exceeding PHP 22,000, the penalty is reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua, which translates to a potential imprisonment of 17 years, 4 months, and 1 day to 40 years. The actual length of imprisonment is determined by the courts, taking into account any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. In addition to imprisonment, the offender may also be ordered to pay restitution to the victim equivalent to the amount stolen.</p>
