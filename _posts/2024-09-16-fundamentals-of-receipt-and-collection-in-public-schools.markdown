<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br/>Can you please explain the fundamentals of receipt and collection in public schools? I need this for further research.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br/>Public schools in the Philippines are governed by laws and policies that regulate the receipt and collection of fees. According to the Department of Education (DepEd), public elementary and secondary schools should not charge fees except for authorized collections such as contributions to the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) or fees during certain school activities like sports meets. DepEd Order No. 19, s. 2008 outlines specific guidelines, including that all receipts should be officially acknowledged through issued receipts. Funds collected must be properly recorded and managed to ensure transparency and accountability. These funds are usually used to support non-curricular activities or enhance school facilities, but must always comply with the rules set by DepEd.</p>
