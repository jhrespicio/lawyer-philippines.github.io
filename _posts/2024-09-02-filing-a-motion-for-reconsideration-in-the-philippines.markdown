This motion must be filed within a prescribed period, usually 15 days from the receipt of the court's decision or order.</p><p>The purpose of the motion for reconsideration is to highlight any errors in the judgment, whether factual or legal, that may have been overlooked or misinterpreted. The party filing the motion must present compelling arguments or new evidence that could significantly impact the courtâ€™s original ruling.</p><p>If the motion for reconsideration is granted, the court may reverse or modify its decision. If denied, the party may elevate the matter to a higher court through an appeal. It is crucial to note that this motion is often a prerequisite before pursuing an appeal, as it demonstrates that all available remedies have been exhausted at the current level of adjudication.</p>
