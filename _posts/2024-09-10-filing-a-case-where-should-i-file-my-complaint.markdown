<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to file a case against someone. Should I file it in the place where the incident happened, or in the barangay where the person Iâ€™m complaining against resides?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In general, the place of filing depends on the type of case. For civil cases, jurisdiction is usually determined by where the defendant resides or where the incident occurred. For small claims or barangay-level disputes, you can file a complaint with the barangay where the defendant lives or where the event took place. If the issue is unresolved at the barangay level, the next step would be to escalate the matter to the proper court. It is advisable to consult with your local barangay officials or legal counsel to clarify jurisdictional rules specific to your case.</p>
