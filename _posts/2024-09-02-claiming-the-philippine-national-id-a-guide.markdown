<p>The Philippine National ID system, known as the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys), aims to provide a single identification card for all citizens. Once an individual’s ID is ready for release, it is essential to know the procedures for claiming it, especially for minors or dependents.</p><p>Typically, the notification for claiming the National ID is sent to the registered address or contact information provided during the application process. However, for minors or dependents, such as in the case of a solo parent’s child, the guardian or parent must claim the ID on their behalf.</p><p>The designated claiming location is usually specified in the notification. This could be the PhilSys Registration Center where the application was filed, or a designated pick-up point, such as a local post office or barangay hall. The claimant must present the notification, along with valid identification and proof of their relationship to the child, such as a birth certificate.</p><p>In cases where the notification has not been received or there is confusion about the claiming process, it is advisable to contact the PhilSys hotline or visit the nearest PhilSys Registration Center for assistance. Additionally, updates on the status of the National ID can be tracked online using the transaction slip number provided during the application.</p><p>Ensuring that all documents are in order and following the correct procedures will help avoid delays in claiming the National ID, ensuring that the process is smooth and efficient.</p>
