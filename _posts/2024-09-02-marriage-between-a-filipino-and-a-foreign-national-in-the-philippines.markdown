<p>Marriages between Filipino citizens and foreign nationals are legally recognized in the Philippines, provided certain legal requirements are met. For a marriage to be valid, both parties must be eligible to marry, meaning they must be of legal age, not currently married, and meet the specific requirements set by Philippine law. For foreign nationals, additional documents are required, such as a legal capacity to marry, which is typically obtained from the foreign national's embassy or consulate. This document certifies that the foreign national is free to marry under the laws of their home country. The couple must also comply with the local requirements, including attending a pre-marriage counseling seminar, securing a marriage license, and ensuring the marriage is solemnized by a recognized authority such as a judge, mayor, or authorized religious minister. Once these requirements are fulfilled, the marriage is considered legally binding and is subject to the same rights and obligations as any other marriage under Philippine law. It is advisable for both parties to consult with legal experts or the respective embassy to ensure all legal prerequisites are met, thus avoiding any potential legal issues that may arise later.</p>
