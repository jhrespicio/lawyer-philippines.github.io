<p>In the Philippines, issues involving minors are treated with utmost care due to the vulnerability of young individuals. The Family Code of the Philippines, particularly Article 35, declares marriages void ab initio if contracted by parties under the age of 18, even with parental consent. This provision underscores the state's stance on protecting minors from the potential consequences of premature decisions such as marriage.</p><p>When both parties in a legal matter, such as a contract or agreement, are underage, the law typically considers these agreements voidable. This means that the contract may be nullified upon the request of one of the parties or their legal guardian. The rationale behind this is that minors are deemed incapable of fully understanding the legal implications of their actions.</p><p>In criminal cases, the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 (Republic Act No. 9344) governs how the legal system should treat minors who commit offenses. Minors, defined as individuals under 18, are not to be held criminally liable in the same manner as adults. Instead, they are subject to interventions and diversion programs aimed at rehabilitation rather than punishment.</p><p>Parents and guardians play a critical role in these situations, as they are often involved in the legal processes and decisions on behalf of the minor. It is advisable for parents or guardians to seek legal counsel when dealing with any legal matters involving minors to ensure the protection of the child's rights and interests.</p>
