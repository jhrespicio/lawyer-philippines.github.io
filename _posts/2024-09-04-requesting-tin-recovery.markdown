<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Is it possible to request the recovery of my TIN number? I seem to have lost it.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Yes, you can request the recovery of your TIN number in the Philippines. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) allows taxpayers to retrieve their TIN through a visit to any BIR branch. Bring valid government-issued identification for verification.</p><p>You may also contact the BIRâ€™s official hotline or email for assistance. There are third-party apps and services associated with the BIR, but be cautious when using them and ensure that they are officially recognized to avoid scams.</p><p>It is important to remember that each taxpayer is only allowed one TIN. If you inadvertently receive multiple TINs, this could lead to problems in your tax filings and may require consolidation.</p>
