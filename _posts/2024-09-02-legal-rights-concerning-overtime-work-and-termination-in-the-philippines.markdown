<p>In the Philippines, the labor laws governing overtime work and termination are clearly outlined in the Labor Code. Employees are generally entitled to decline overtime work, especially if it is beyond the regular working hours established in their employment contract. Employers, however, may require overtime if it is necessary to prevent serious losses or meet deadlines, provided that the employee is compensated accordingly with overtime pay.</p><p>An employee cannot be terminated solely for refusing to work overtime, as this would be considered an unjust or illegal dismissal. Termination must be based on just causes, such as serious misconduct, gross neglect of duties, or willful disobedience of lawful orders, among others. If an employer attempts to terminate an employee for refusing to work overtime without a valid reason, the employee may file a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</p><p>Employees have the right to due process, which includes the right to be informed of the reasons for termination and the opportunity to defend themselves. If terminated, an employee may also be entitled to separation pay depending on the circumstances surrounding the dismissal. It is crucial for both employees and employers to understand these legal provisions to ensure fair treatment in the workplace.</p>
