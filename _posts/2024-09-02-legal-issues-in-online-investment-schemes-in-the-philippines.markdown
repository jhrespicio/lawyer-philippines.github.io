<p>Online investment schemes have become increasingly popular in the Philippines, but they also come with significant legal risks. Under Philippine law, particularly the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and the Revised Penal Code, individuals involved in promoting or facilitating fraudulent investment schemes can be held criminally and civilly liable. These schemes often involve promises of high returns with minimal risk, which can attract unwary investors, including minors.</p><p>When an individual encourages others to invest in an online scheme, they may be held liable if the scheme turns out to be fraudulent, even if they were unaware of the illegality at the time. The liability can extend to those who act as intermediaries, facilitating the transfer of funds to the promoters of the scheme. This is particularly concerning in cases where the transactions are conducted through online payment platforms, making it difficult to trace the money.</p><p>Parents should exercise caution and supervise their childrenâ€™s online activities, particularly involving financial transactions. Individuals who fall victim to such schemes have the right to file complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Victims may also pursue civil cases to recover their losses. To avoid legal and financial repercussions, it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any online opportunity and to be wary of offers that seem too good to be true.</p>
