<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Someone posted on Facebook about my friend's debt, embarrassing her publicly. Is there anything we can do to address this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Publicly posting about someone's debt with the intent to shame or embarrass them can be considered cyber libel under the Philippine Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Your friend can file a formal complaint for cyber libel with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Policeâ€™s Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG). Furthermore, she may also seek damages in a civil case for the harm caused by these defamatory statements. It is advisable to gather all evidence, including screenshots of the posts, and seek legal advice to take the appropriate legal steps.</p>
