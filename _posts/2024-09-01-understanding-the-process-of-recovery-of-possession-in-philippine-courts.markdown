<p>The recovery of possession, also known as accion publiciana or accion reivindicatoria, refers to legal actions that aim to recover property from another person who is unlawfully withholding it. The process begins with the filing of a complaint in the appropriate court. Depending on the circumstances, such cases can be filed either in the Municipal Trial Court or the Regional Trial Court.</p><p>The length of time it takes to recover possession depends on several factors, including the complexity of the case, the court's caseload, and the willingness of the parties to settle. Typically, these cases can take several months to a few years to resolve, from filing to the final execution of the court’s decision.</p><p>After a decision is rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the losing party may still appeal the decision, potentially extending the recovery process. Once the judgment becomes final and executory, the plaintiff can request the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce the court’s ruling and recover possession of the property.</p>
