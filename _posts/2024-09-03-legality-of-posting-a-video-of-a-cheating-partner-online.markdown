<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My boyfriend cheated on me, and I have a video showing him with another woman. I want to expose them by posting the video online. Is this legal?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Posting a video that shows someone engaging in private acts, such as infidelity, without their consent can expose you to legal risks, particularly under the Philippine Data Privacy Act and Anti-Voyeurism Law. These laws protect individuals' privacy rights and prohibit the unauthorized distribution of intimate or private content. Even if the video is factual, posting it online can be considered a violation of privacy and may result in legal consequences, including criminal charges. It's important to consider the potential repercussions before sharing such content. Instead of posting the video online, it would be wiser to seek legal advice and explore other legal remedies, such as filing a case for infidelity or psychological violence under the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act, if applicable.</p>
