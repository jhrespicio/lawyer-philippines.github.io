<p>Scams on social media platforms like Facebook and Messenger are unfortunately common. Victims of such scams can report the incident to the Philippine National Police's Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) or the National Bureau of Investigation's Cybercrime Division (NBI-Cybercrime). It is important to collect as much evidence as possible, such as screenshots of conversations, transaction records, and the profiles of the scammers. Reporting the scam to the platform itself can also lead to the scammer's account being suspended or banned. Additionally, victims may seek legal advice to explore the possibility of filing charges for cyber fraud or estafa under the Revised Penal Code, in conjunction with the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175).</p>
