<p>It is not uncommon for individuals to receive messages or notifications claiming that they are involved in a legal case, even when they are unaware of any wrongdoing. These messages can cause significant stress, especially for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are far from home. If you receive such a message, it is important to verify its authenticity before taking any action. Scammers often use fake legal threats to extort money or information. To verify the legitimacy of a claim, you can check with the relevant court or government agency. It is also advisable to consult with a legal professional who can help assess the situation and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to take. If the claim is found to be false, you may report the incident to the authorities to prevent further harassment. Protecting yourself from potential legal scams requires vigilance and prompt action.</p>
