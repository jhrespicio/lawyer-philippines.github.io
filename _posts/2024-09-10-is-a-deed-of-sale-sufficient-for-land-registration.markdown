<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I purchased a property from someone who had an Absolute Deed of Sale from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), but they were unable to secure a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) from the Registry of Deeds (ROD). Now, I want to register the property under my name. Is the Deed of Sale enough to get the property titled?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>A Deed of Sale is a key document in proving ownership, but it is not sufficient on its own to apply for a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) from the Registry of Deeds (ROD). To process the registration, additional documents are required, including a certified true copy of the title from the seller, tax declarations, and clearance from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for the payment of capital gains and documentary stamp taxes. You may also need to present other documents depending on the circumstances. It is best to consult with the ROD or a legal expert to ensure you have all the necessary documents for registration and titling.</p>
