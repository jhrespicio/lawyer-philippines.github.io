<p>In the Philippines, filing for annulment is a legal process that can dissolve a marriage on specific grounds outlined in the Family Code. One common question is whether it is possible to file for annulment even if the spouses are still living together. The answer is yes, but certain conditions and considerations must be taken into account.</p><p>Under Philippine law, the grounds for annulment include psychological incapacity, fraud, lack of parental consent (for those under 18 years old at the time of marriage), impotence, and serious infectious diseases, among others. The fact that spouses continue to live together does not preclude the filing of an annulment case, as long as one of these grounds is present and can be proven in court.</p><p>Living together during the annulment process can present challenges, particularly when it comes to proving certain grounds like psychological incapacity. The court will require convincing evidence that the incapacity existed at the time of the marriage and that it is incurable. This often involves testimony from psychologists or psychiatrists, as well as other forms of evidence that demonstrate the incapacity's impact on the marriage.</p><p>It is also important to note that filing for annulment while living together does not automatically mean that the other spouse must leave the conjugal home. Until the court issues a decision, both spouses retain their legal rights and obligations toward each other, including their right to reside in the marital home. In some cases, spouses may choose to continue living together for practical reasons, such as for the sake of their children or due to financial constraints.</p><p>Ultimately, filing for annulment is a serious legal step that requires careful consideration of the grounds for annulment, the evidence available, and the potential impact on the family. Consulting with a legal expert who specializes in family law is crucial to ensure that the process is handled correctly and that the rights of all parties involved are protected.</p>
