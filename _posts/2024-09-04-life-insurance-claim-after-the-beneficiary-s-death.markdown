<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My brother passed away in February, and my mother, as his life insurance beneficiary, submitted the necessary requirements. Unfortunately, my mother also passed away in June before receiving the insurance payout. How should I proceed to claim the benefits now?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>When the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy passes away before receiving the benefit, the payout does not automatically go to the next of kin. Here are the key steps you can take:</p><ul><li><strong>Review the policy:</strong> Check if there is a secondary or contingent beneficiary listed. If one is named, that person will receive the insurance payout.</li><li><strong>If no contingent beneficiary is named:</strong> The life insurance proceeds may be considered part of your mother’s estate. In this case, the benefit would be distributed according to the rules of succession under Philippine law.</li><li><strong>File a claim through your mother's estate:</strong> If your mother’s estate is already undergoing settlement, the heirs can pursue the life insurance claim as part of her estate. You may need to submit proof of your mother's death and her relationship to your brother to the insurance company.</li><li><strong>Consult with a lawyer:</strong> It is advisable to seek legal assistance to navigate the claims process and ensure that the proceeds are properly distributed according to the law.</li></ul><p>The timeline and requirements for claiming the benefits may vary, so it is important to act promptly and seek the necessary legal guidance.</p>
