<p>When inviting a relative to visit the Philippines, one of the crucial documents that may be required by immigration authorities is an Affidavit of Support. This document serves as a guarantee that the inviting party will take full financial responsibility for the visitor during their stay in the country. The Affidavit of Support typically needs to be notarized and may require submission alongside other documents, such as proof of financial capability and a copy of the inviting party’s ID.

The affidavit generally must be presented to the Philippine Bureau of Immigration or the embassy or consulate in the invitee’s home country.</p>
