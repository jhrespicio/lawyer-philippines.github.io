<p>In the Philippines, workers are entitled to various benefits under the Labor Code, including the 13th-month pay, Social Security System (SSS) contributions, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG Fund benefits. Employers are required to provide these benefits to their employees, and failure to do so constitutes a violation of labor laws. Workers who believe their rights have been violated can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The DOLE investigates such complaints and can order the employer to comply with the law, including payment of unpaid benefits, back wages, and other entitlements. Workers are also entitled to separation pay under certain conditions, such as retrenchment, redundancy, or closure of the business. Legal action can be taken if the employer fails to provide the legally mandated benefits.</p>
