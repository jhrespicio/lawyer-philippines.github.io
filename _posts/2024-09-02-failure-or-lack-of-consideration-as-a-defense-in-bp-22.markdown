<p><strong>Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22)</strong>, also known as the Anti-Bouncing Checks Law, penalizes the issuance of a check that is subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds or a closed account. The law aims to protect the stability and credibility of commercial transactions by ensuring that checks serve their intended purpose as a reliable substitute for cash.</p><p>In the context of BP 22, <em>failure or lack of consideration</em> is not a valid defense against prosecution. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the liability for issuing a bouncing check is independent of the underlying obligation that gave rise to the issuance of the check. This means that even if there was no consideration or the transaction was void, the act of issuing a check that bounces still constitutes an offense under BP 22.</p><p>Under this principle, the law seeks to focus on the act of issuing the check rather than the circumstances surrounding the transaction. The rationale is that BP 22 aims to maintain the integrity of checks as instruments of trade and commerce. Allowing the defense of lack of consideration would undermine this objective by encouraging the reckless issuance of checks, knowing that such a defense could absolve the issuer of liability.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that the absence of consideration may be relevant in a civil case concerning the underlying transaction, but it does not extinguish criminal liability under BP 22. Therefore, when facing charges under BP 22, the accused cannot use failure or lack of consideration as a defense to evade criminal prosecution.</p>
