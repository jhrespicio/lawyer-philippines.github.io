<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My employer has been withholding my salary for nearly a month now, claiming that there is an ongoing case against me, but they have not provided any details or legal documents such as a subpoena. Is this legal, and what can I do to resolve this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine labor laws, an employer cannot withhold an employee's salary without a valid reason. Withholding salaries due to an alleged case without providing proper legal grounds, such as a subpoena or a formal notice, is not lawful. Employers must follow due process, including giving the employee a chance to be heard and providing sufficient details about any disciplinary action. The employee has the right to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for illegal withholding of wages. Furthermore, Article 116 of the Labor Code states that employers cannot withhold wages except in cases authorized by law, such as government-mandated deductions or court orders.</p>
