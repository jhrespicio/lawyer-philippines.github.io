<p>In the Philippines, adult adoption is legally permissible and follows a process similar to that of adopting a minor. The adopter must file a petition for adoption with the Family Court, and the court will consider various factors, such as the relationship between the adopter and the adoptee, the adopter's capability to care for the adoptee, and the consent of the adoptee. Once granted, the adoption decree will legally recognize the adoptee as the child of the adopter, with all the rights and responsibilities of a biological child. Regarding international recognition, such as in Canada for immigration sponsorship, the adopted person must comply with the immigration laws of the country where they seek recognition. It's advisable to consult with legal experts in both the Philippines and the target country to ensure the adoption will be honored for immigration purposes.</p>
