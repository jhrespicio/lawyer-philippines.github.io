<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was employed as a teacher on July 29, 2024. Am I eligible to receive the 13th-month pay?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the 13th-month pay is a mandatory benefit provided to all rank-and-file employees, regardless of the nature of their employment and irrespective of the methods by which their wages are paid. The requirement to receive the 13th-month pay applies to all employees who have worked for at least one month during the calendar year. Since you were employed on July 29, 2024, you are eligible for a prorated 13th-month pay based on the number of months you have worked within the year. The computation will be proportional to the time you were employed, meaning you will receive a fraction of the full 13th-month pay equivalent to the period you have rendered service for your employer.</p>
