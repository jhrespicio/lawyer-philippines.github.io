<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>Three of my engineers are resigning in the middle of an important project. Unfortunately, I have no employment contract or company policy established. They gave me a one-month notice, which is legal, but I am concerned it is not enough time for a proper turnover. What can I do in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the absence of a written contract or established company policies, labor laws in the Philippines generally govern the situation. The one-month notice provided by your engineers complies with Article 285 of the Labor Code, which allows an employee to resign by giving due notice to the employer at least one month in advance. While this may be challenging for project continuity, without a specific agreement in place requiring a longer turnover period, there may be limited legal recourse. Moving forward, it's essential to establish employment contracts and company policies to address issues like turnover and project handovers more effectively.</p>
