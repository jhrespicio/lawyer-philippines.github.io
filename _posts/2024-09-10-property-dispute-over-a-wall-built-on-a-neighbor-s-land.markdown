<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>We recently sold a piece of land, and the new owner wants to demolish a wall that was built by the previous owner because they claim that part of the land near the wall belongs to them. What should we do in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In property disputes like this, the new owner may assert their right to the land that they legally own. However, the exact boundaries of the property must be properly established. You can consult a geodetic engineer to conduct a land survey and verify the property lines based on the title. If the wall encroaches on the new owner's property, they have the right to request its removal. It is advisable to amicably resolve the matter, but if no agreement is reached, either party may seek judicial intervention to determine the legal boundaries and resolve the dispute.</p>
