<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I registered for my ePhilID last 2022, but I did not receive the physical card. Unfortunately, I also lost my transaction reference number (TRN). How can I proceed with securing my ePhilID without the TRN, and what steps should I take to get my identification?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you have lost your TRN, you can still recover your ePhilID by visiting the nearest PhilSys Registration Center. Provide them with other forms of identification such as a valid government ID or a birth certificate. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has established protocols for such cases, and they may be able to retrieve your information using alternative identification methods. You can also try contacting their helpline or accessing their official online platforms to check the status of your ePhilID issuance. It is important to follow up persistently to ensure that you receive your ePhilID.</p>
