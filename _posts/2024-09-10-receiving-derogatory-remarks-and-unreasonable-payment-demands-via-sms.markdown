<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have been receiving derogatory remarks and slang messages via SMS from a creditor. I am trying to settle my debt through an installment plan, but they are forcing me to pay the full amount immediately. What can I do to stop the harassment and negotiate a fair payment plan?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The harassment you are experiencing from your creditor, especially through derogatory remarks, is not acceptable. Under Philippine law, particularly the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act (RA 9262), the use of verbal abuse, including derogatory language, may be actionable if it constitutes psychological violence. Additionally, creditors are expected to follow ethical practices in debt collection. If the creditor is a debt collection agency, they must comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices regulations set by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which prohibit unfair collection practices such as harassment, threats, or abuse. You have the right to file a complaint against the creditor with the appropriate authorities, such as the BSP or the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), depending on the nature of the creditor. Furthermore, if you are unable to pay the debt in full, you may negotiate a payment plan and propose an alternative arrangement that is within your financial capacity. It would be advisable to document all communications and seek the assistance of a lawyer to help mediate the situation and prevent further harassment.</p>
