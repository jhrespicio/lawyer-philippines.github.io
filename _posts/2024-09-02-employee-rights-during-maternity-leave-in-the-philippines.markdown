<p>The Philippine labor laws provide strong protections for female employees, particularly regarding maternity leave. Under Republic Act No. 11210, also known as the Expanded Maternity Leave Law, female employees are entitled to 105 days of paid maternity leave, with the option of extending for an additional 30 days without pay. This protection extends to all female employees in both the public and private sectors. The law prohibits employers from terminating an employee during her maternity leave, provided that the employee has complied with all necessary requirements, such as submitting the appropriate leave application and medical documentation. Any termination during this period, especially if it is connected to the employee's pregnancy or maternity leave, is considered unlawful dismissal. Affected employees may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or pursue legal action through the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) to seek redress, including reinstatement and back pay.</p>
