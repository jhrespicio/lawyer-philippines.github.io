<p>Pregnant women in the Philippines are protected under several labor laws that ensure their rights in the workplace. The Labor Code of the Philippines and other related laws prohibit discrimination against pregnant employees. If a pregnant employee is placed on bench status without pay due to her pregnancy, this could constitute a violation of her rights. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, particularly those with high-risk pregnancies. This can include granting requests for flexible work arrangements, such as a hybrid setup. If an employer refuses to accommodate these requests or places the employee on unpaid status, the employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Furthermore, upon returning from maternity leave, the employee has the right to be reinstated to her former position or an equivalent one. Any adverse actions by the employer could be considered discriminatory and may be challenged legally.</p>
