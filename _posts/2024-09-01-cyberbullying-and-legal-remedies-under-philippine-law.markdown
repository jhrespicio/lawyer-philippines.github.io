<p>Cyberbullying is a serious concern in the Philippines, and the law provides remedies for victims. Under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175), posting false accusations or defamatory statements online can be considered cyberlibel, a punishable offense. Victims of cyberbullying can file a complaint with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Cybercrime Division. If the false accusations damage a person's reputation, the offender can be held liable for both civil and criminal penalties, which may include imprisonment and fines. It is crucial for individuals to exercise caution and responsibility when posting content online to avoid legal repercussions.</p>
