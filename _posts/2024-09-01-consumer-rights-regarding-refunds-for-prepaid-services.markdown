<p>In the Philippines, consumers have the right to seek refunds for prepaid services if they have not yet availed of those services and if they feel they were misled into purchasing them. This is protected under the Consumer Act of the Philippines, which mandates that businesses must be truthful in their advertising and sales practices. If a consumer discovers that similar services are available elsewhere at a significantly lower price, they may have grounds to request a refund, especially if they have not yet used any of the prepaid services. The consumer should first communicate directly with the business to request a refund. If the business refuses, the consumer may file a complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or seek legal recourse through the courts. Documentation, such as receipts and records of the transaction, will be crucial in supporting the consumer's claim.</p>
