<p>In the Philippines, the Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC) Act provides legal protection to women and children from various forms of abuse, including physical, psychological, and emotional abuse. Narcissistic abuse, characterized by manipulative and controlling behavior, can be considered a form of psychological abuse under the VAWC Act. Victims of narcissistic abuse can file for protection orders, which can include provisions for the abuser to stay away from the victim, to provide financial support, and to undergo counseling. It is important for victims to document instances of abuse and seek the assistance of legal professionals to file the necessary complaints.</p>
