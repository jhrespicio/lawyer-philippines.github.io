<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I discovered that I have two birth certificates due to dual registration. I want to cancel the first registration because my second one is locked and cannot be used. What steps should I take to resolve this issue?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In cases of dual registration of birth certificates, you need to file a petition in court to cancel the first registration. The court will evaluate the reasons for the dual registration and issue a decision to cancel the incorrect record. This process typically requires presenting documentary evidence such as both birth certificates and identification documents. You may need to consult with the Local Civil Registry where the birth certificates were registered, and they can guide you through the necessary steps and legal requirements. A lawyer can help prepare and file the petition to ensure that the correct birth certificate remains in effect, and any records affected by the dual registration can be corrected.</p>
