<p>In the Philippines, the obligation to pay debts generally does not automatically cease upon the death of a debtor. The creditor may still seek payment from the estate of the deceased. The estate refers to all the assets and liabilities left behind by the deceased. The creditor must file a claim against the estate during the probate or settlement of the estate process. This claim must be done within a specific period, often prescribed by the court overseeing the estate proceedings. If the claim is recognized, it will be paid out from the estate’s assets before any distribution to the heirs. However, if the estate lacks sufficient assets to cover all debts, the debts may go unpaid, and the creditors may not pursue the heirs personally unless they were co-signers or guarantors of the debt. It is advisable for creditors to consult with a legal professional to navigate the process of filing a claim against a deceased debtor’s estate properly.</p>
