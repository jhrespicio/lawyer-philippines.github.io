<p>In the Philippines, a mother title refers to the original title of a large parcel of land that has not yet been subdivided. When a portion of this land is sold, the buyer needs to secure a separate title for the purchased portion. The process of separating a title from a mother title involves several steps, including securing a Deed of Sale, submitting a subdivision plan approved by the Land Registration Authority (LRA), and paying the required taxes and fees. Once these steps are completed, the Register of Deeds can issue a new title in the buyer's name. This process ensures that the buyer has a legal and distinct title for the specific portion of land they purchased.</p>
