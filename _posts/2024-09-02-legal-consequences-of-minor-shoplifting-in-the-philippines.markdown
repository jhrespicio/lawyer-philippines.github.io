<p>Shoplifting, regardless of the value of the stolen item, is considered theft under Philippine law. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, particularly Article 308, defines theft as the unlawful taking of personal property with intent to gain, without the consent of the owner. Even minor shoplifting, involving items of small value, is subject to legal penalties.</p><p>The penalties for theft are determined by the value of the property stolen. For minor shoplifting, where the value of the goods is relatively low, the penalties may include imprisonment, fines, or both, depending on the circumstances of the offense and the discretion of the court. The law allows for mitigating circumstances, such as voluntary return of the stolen item or first-time offense, which may reduce the severity of the penalty.</p><p>In addition to criminal charges, individuals caught shoplifting may also face civil liabilities, such as the obligation to pay for the value of the stolen goods and any damages caused to the store. Store owners may also ban individuals caught shoplifting from entering their premises in the future.</p><p>For minors caught shoplifting, the situation is handled differently. The Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act (Republic Act No. 9344) provides that minors, particularly those under the age of 15, are exempt from criminal liability but may be subject to intervention programs designed for their rehabilitation. However, if a minor between the ages of 15 and 18 commits shoplifting and is found to have acted with discernment, they may face criminal charges, though the penalties may be adjusted according to the law's provisions for juvenile offenders.</p><p>It is important for those accused of shoplifting to seek legal counsel to navigate the legal process and explore options for mitigating penalties. Additionally, rehabilitation programs may be recommended to prevent recidivism, particularly in cases involving minors.</p>
