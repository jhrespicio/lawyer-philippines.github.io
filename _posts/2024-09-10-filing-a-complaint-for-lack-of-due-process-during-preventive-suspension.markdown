<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was placed under preventive suspension by my employer after a co-employee accused me of harassment. The suspension was issued verbally without any formal process or investigation. Can I file a complaint against my employer for failing to provide due process?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the Labor Code ensures that employees have the right to due process. Before any disciplinary action, including preventive suspension, an employer must conduct a thorough investigation, provide formal written notice of the complaint, and allow the employee to respond. Preventive suspension should only be imposed if the employee poses a threat to company safety or property, and it should not exceed 30 days. If these procedures were not followed, you may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for unfair labor practices and violation of due process.</p>
