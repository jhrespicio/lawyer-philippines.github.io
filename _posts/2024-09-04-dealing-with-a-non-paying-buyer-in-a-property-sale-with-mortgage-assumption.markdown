<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I sold a condo property under a deed of sale with an assumption of mortgage. The buyer has not made payments for two months and is being difficult. I want to take back the property, but the buyer is insisting on a refund of their downpayment before leaving. Is this allowed?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The deed of sale with assumption of mortgage allows the buyer to assume responsibility for the remaining mortgage, but failure to make payments could be considered a breach of contract. Depending on the terms in the deed of sale, you may be entitled to rescind the contract and repossess the property. However, whether you are required to refund the downpayment depends on the terms of your agreement. Typically, non-payment may result in the forfeiture of the downpayment, but it is essential to review the specific terms outlined in your contract. Consulting a lawyer to assess the contract and determine the best legal course of action is recommended.</p>
