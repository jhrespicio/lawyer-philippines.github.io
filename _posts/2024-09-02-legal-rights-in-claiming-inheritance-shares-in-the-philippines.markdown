<p>Inheritance disputes are common in the Philippines, and understanding one's legal rights is crucial when claiming a share in an estate. Under Philippine law, the inheritance process is governed by the Civil Code, which outlines the rules on succession. Succession can be either testate, where a will is present, or intestate, where no will exists.</p><p>In the case of intestate succession, the law provides a clear hierarchy of heirs, which typically includes the spouse, children, parents, and, in their absence, more distant relatives. Each category of heirs has a predetermined share of the estate, and these shares must be distributed according to the law.</p><p>If a will exists, it must be probated before any distribution of assets can occur. The probate process validates the will and ensures that it complies with legal requirements. Heirs who feel that they are not receiving their fair share of the inheritance have the right to contest the will or the distribution in court. However, this can be a lengthy and complex process, requiring the assistance of a knowledgeable lawyer.</p><p>Understanding these legal principles and seeking appropriate legal counsel are essential steps in protecting oneâ€™s inheritance rights in the Philippines.</p>
