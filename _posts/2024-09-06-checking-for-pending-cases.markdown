<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I want to find out if there are any pending legal cases against me. How can I check this, and what steps should I take to clear up any concerns?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> To verify if you have any pending legal cases, you can request a National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, which reflects criminal cases, or check with the courts in your local area for any civil or criminal proceedings filed against you. Additionally, you may consult the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) or a private lawyer for assistance in tracking your legal standing. If there is a pending case, it's crucial to seek legal counsel immediately to address the matter appropriately.</p>
