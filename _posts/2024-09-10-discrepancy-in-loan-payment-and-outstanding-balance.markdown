<p>Dear Attorney,</p><p>My concern is about a loan payment I made last year. I paid on the due date, but the creditor claims they received it a day late, and now they are saying I have an outstanding balance. I have visited their office, but they only give automated replies. How can I address this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>If you have proof that you paid your loan on time, such as a receipt or transaction record, you have grounds to dispute any additional charges or outstanding balances. Start by formally communicating with your lender through written correspondence (email or letter) to document your case. If the issue persists, you can file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), depending on the nature of your creditor. These institutions can assist in mediating disputes between financial institutions and borrowers.</p>
