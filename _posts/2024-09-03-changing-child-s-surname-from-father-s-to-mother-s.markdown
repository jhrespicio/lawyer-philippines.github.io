<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My child was acknowledged by the father and currently uses his surname. However, I would like my child to use my surname instead. Is this possible?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, a legitimate child or a child recognized by the father generally uses the father's surname. To change the surname of a child from the father's to the mother's, there are specific legal procedures that need to be followed. You would need to file a petition for the change of surname in court, stating the reasons for the request. The court will consider factors such as the best interest of the child and whether the change of surname will not cause confusion or harm. If the court finds justifiable reasons, it may grant the petition. It is advisable to consult with a family lawyer to guide you through this legal process.</p>
