<p>Carnapping, or the theft of a motor vehicle, is a serious crime in the Philippines. Investigating such cases typically involves coordination between the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies. The investigation process starts with the filing of a formal complaint by the vehicle owner. Law enforcement agencies then conduct an initial investigation, which may include interviewing witnesses, reviewing CCTV footage, and tracing the vehicle through the Land Transportation Office (LTO) records. If the vehicle is found, it is crucial to secure the chain of custody and preserve evidence for possible court proceedings. The Anti-Carnapping Act of 2016 (Republic Act No. 10883) outlines the penalties and legal procedures for such cases.</p>
