<p>Harassment by online lending apps has become a significant concern in the Philippines, particularly with the rise of digital lending platforms. Borrowers who experience harassment from these apps have several legal remedies at their disposal. The first step is to document all instances of harassment, including screenshots of messages, call logs, and any other forms of communication. The borrower can then file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) if the harassment involves violations of privacy, such as unauthorized access to personal contacts or public shaming. Additionally, the borrower may report the incident to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) if the lending app is a regulated entity. Legal action can also be taken under the Anti-Cybercrime Law or other relevant laws. Consulting with a lawyer can help in determining the most appropriate course of action and in filing the necessary legal complaints.</p>
