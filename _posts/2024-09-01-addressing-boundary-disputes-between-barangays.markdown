<p>Boundary disputes between barangays in the Philippines are common and can lead to conflicts that affect local governance and community relations. The Local Government Code of 1991 provides a framework for resolving such disputes. Initially, the disputing barangays are encouraged to settle the matter amicably through mediation and negotiation. If these efforts fail, the issue can be brought to the Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan, which can form a committee to investigate and make recommendations. If the dispute remains unresolved, it can be escalated to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for further mediation. In cases where administrative remedies are exhausted without resolution, the dispute may be taken to the courts for adjudication. Clear documentation, including maps and historical records, is crucial in these proceedings.</p>
