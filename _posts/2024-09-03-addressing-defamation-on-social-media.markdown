<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>A friend’s picture was posted on an LGBT page with defamatory statements. What legal action can be taken against the person responsible?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, posting defamatory statements on social media can be grounds for a criminal complaint for libel under the Revised Penal Code, as amended by the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). To pursue this, your friend should gather evidence, including screenshots of the defamatory post and any relevant comments. A formal complaint can then be filed with the local police or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Additionally, a civil case for damages can be filed under Article 26 of the Civil Code if the defamation caused harm to your friend’s reputation. It's crucial to act quickly, as libel cases have a one-year prescription period.</p>
