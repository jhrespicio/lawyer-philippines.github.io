<p>Libel, as defined under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, involves the malicious imputation of a crime, vice, defect, or any act that dishonors or discredits a person. With the advent of technology, libel committed through online platforms is addressed by the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175), which broadens the scope of libel to include digital platforms. If you believe that you have been defamed online, you can file a complaint for cyber libel. The process begins with the filing of a formal complaint at the nearest police station or the Cybercrime Division of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Evidence such as screenshots, URLs, and other digital records should be gathered to support your claim. The complaint will be subjected to an investigation, and if probable cause is found, charges may be filed in court. Legal representation is highly recommended to navigate the complexities of cyber libel cases.</p>
