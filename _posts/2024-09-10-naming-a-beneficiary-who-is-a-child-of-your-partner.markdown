<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I want to name my partner’s child, whom I treat as my own, as the beneficiary of my assets. I don’t have parents anymore, and the child carries my last name. Can I legally do this, and how should I proceed?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, a person has the freedom to name anyone as their beneficiary for life insurance, pension, or other financial accounts, regardless of whether the beneficiary is a biological child or not. Since the child already carries your last name, this should not pose an issue in naming them as a beneficiary. However, if you wish to provide inheritance rights, it would be prudent to include them in your will. Ensure that you formalize this in writing, preferably through legal counsel, to avoid potential complications. It's also important to ensure that the designation complies with the rules of the institution involved (e.g., insurance company, pension fund).</p>
