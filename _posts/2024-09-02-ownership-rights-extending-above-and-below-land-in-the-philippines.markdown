<p>In the Philippines, the concept of land ownership is governed by both civil law and property law, which include provisions about the extent of ownership rights above and below the land. According to the Civil Code of the Philippines, a landowner has rights not only to the surface of the land but also to everything beneath it and the airspace above it, subject to certain limitations.</p><p>These rights are known as the doctrine of <em>cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos</em>, meaning 'whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to the heavens and down to the depths of the earth.' However, these rights are not absolute. For instance, airspace rights are limited by regulations concerning aviation and other public utilities. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) regulates the airspace for aviation safety, and landowners cannot obstruct this airspace.</p><p>Similarly, subsurface rights are subject to laws governing natural resources. The Philippine Mining Act of 1995 and the Oil Exploration and Development Act limit landowners' rights to the minerals and resources found beneath their property. The state owns all natural resources, and the government may grant permits or concessions to third parties to explore and extract these resources, even on privately owned land. Landowners are entitled to just compensation if their property is used for such purposes.</p><p>In conclusion, while landowners in the Philippines enjoy rights to the airspace and subsurface of their property, these rights are subject to significant regulatory limitations intended to balance private property rights with public interest and resource management.</p>
