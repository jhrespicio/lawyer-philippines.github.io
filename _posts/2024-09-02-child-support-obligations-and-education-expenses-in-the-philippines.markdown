<p>In the Philippines, child support is a legal obligation that a parent must fulfill to provide for the needs of their child. This obligation includes not only basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter but also education expenses. The amount of child support is generally determined based on the parent's financial capacity and the needs of the child. However, disputes often arise when the custodial parent believes that the support provided is insufficient to cover educational costs.</p><p>While a fixed amount may be agreed upon or mandated by the court for monthly support, education is considered an essential need, and both parents are typically responsible for ensuring that their children receive proper schooling. If the current support amount does not cover educational expenses, the custodial parent may request an adjustment through legal channels. This adjustment can be done by filing a petition in family court to increase the support amount to account for tuition fees and other school-related costs.</p><p>Itâ€™s crucial for both parents to recognize that the best interests of the child should always be the primary concern. In cases where one parent refuses to contribute to education expenses despite their financial ability, the custodial parent can seek legal remedies to compel the other parent to fulfill their obligation. Consulting a family lawyer can provide guidance on how to proceed with legal action to ensure that the child's educational needs are met.</p>
