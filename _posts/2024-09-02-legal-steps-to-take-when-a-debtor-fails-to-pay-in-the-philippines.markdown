<p>In the Philippines, when a debtor fails to repay a loan, creditors have several legal avenues to pursue repayment. Initially, the creditor may file a demand letter, formally requesting payment of the outstanding amount. If the debtor still fails to pay, the creditor can escalate the matter by filing a case with the appropriate court, such as a Small Claims Court, depending on the amount in question. In Small Claims Court, the process is simplified, and parties are not required to have legal representation, making it a cost-effective option for recovering debts. If the debtor refuses to receive court notices or continues to evade payment, the court may issue a default judgment, allowing the creditor to pursue enforcement measures, such as garnishment of wages or seizure of assets. It's essential for creditors to maintain clear documentation of the loan and any communications with the debtor to support their case effectively.</p>
