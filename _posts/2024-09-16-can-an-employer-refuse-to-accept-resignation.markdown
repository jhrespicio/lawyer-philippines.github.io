<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I submitted my resignation letter, but my employer refuses to accept it. I stopped reporting to work on January 17. What are my rights regarding this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, an employee has the right to resign from their job at any time, provided they give a 30-day notice, as outlined in the Labor Code. The employer cannot refuse a resignation if the proper process is followed. If youâ€™ve given your notice and your employer still refuses to accept your resignation, you are not obligated to continue working beyond the notice period. You may stop reporting for work after 30 days. If the employer takes any adverse actions, such as withholding your final pay, you may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for proper resolution.</p>
