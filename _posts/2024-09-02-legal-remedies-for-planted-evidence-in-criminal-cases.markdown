<p>The planting of evidence, particularly in drug-related cases, is a serious legal issue in the Philippines. The law explicitly prohibits and penalizes the planting of evidence under Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. This act provides severe penalties for law enforcement officers or any individuals found guilty of planting evidence to falsely incriminate someone.</p><p>In situations where a person is falsely accused due to planted evidence, such as marijuana, the accused has several legal remedies. The first step is to ensure that the accused is represented by competent legal counsel who can challenge the validity of the evidence in court. The defense can file a motion to suppress the evidence if there is reason to believe it was planted. This motion argues that the evidence should be excluded from the trial because it was obtained through illegal means.</p><p>The defense may also request a re-examination of the evidence by independent forensic experts to verify its authenticity and whether proper chain of custody protocols were followed. In many drug-related cases, the chain of custody is crucial in proving whether the evidence was handled properly from the time of seizure to its presentation in court.</p><p>If the court finds that the evidence was indeed planted, the case against the accused may be dismissed. Moreover, those responsible for planting the evidence could face criminal charges themselves, including imprisonment and fines, under the provisions of the law.</p><p>Filing a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) or the Ombudsman is also an option if there is evidence that law enforcement officers were involved in planting the evidence. These bodies can conduct independent investigations and hold those responsible accountable.</p><p>It is essential for individuals facing such accusations to act swiftly and seek legal assistance to protect their rights and ensure that justice is served.</p>
