<p>A Special Power of Attorney (SPA) is a legal document in the Philippines that allows an individual (the principal) to authorize another person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on their behalf for specific transactions or activities. The SPA is commonly used in various scenarios, such as when the principal is unable to personally attend to legal matters, financial transactions, or property management due to absence or other reasons.</p><p>Under Article 1878 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, an SPA is required for specific acts, including but not limited to: filing a suit in court, selling or mortgaging property, managing a business, and entering into contracts. The SPA must clearly specify the scope of authority granted to the agent, the specific acts they are authorized to perform, and any limitations or conditions imposed by the principal.</p><p>For an SPA to be legally binding, it must be notarized by a notary public, ensuring that the document was executed voluntarily by the principal. The notary public also affirms the authenticity of the principal's identity and the validity of the document. In certain cases, particularly for transactions involving real estate or large financial sums, the SPA may need to be authenticated by the Philippine Embassy or Consulate if executed abroad.</p><p>It is important to note that the authority granted through an SPA is revocable at any time by the principal, provided that the revocation is communicated to the agent and any third parties involved in the transactions. The SPA automatically terminates upon the death of the principal or the agent.</p>
