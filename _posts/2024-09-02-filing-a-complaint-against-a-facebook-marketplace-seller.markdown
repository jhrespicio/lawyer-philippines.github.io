<p>When engaging in transactions on Facebook Marketplace, buyers sometimes encounter issues with sellers, such as receiving defective items, non-delivery of goods, or misrepresentation of products. In such cases, it is essential to know the proper steps for filing a complaint against a seller.</p><p>Firstly, the buyer should try to resolve the issue directly with the seller through the platform's messaging system. Clear communication may help in settling disputes without escalating the matter. If the issue remains unresolved, the buyer can report the seller to Facebook. To do this, the buyer needs to go to the order in question, click on the seller's name, and select the option to report the seller. Facebook reviews these reports and may take action, such as removing the seller from the platform or banning their account.</p><p>In addition to reporting to Facebook, buyers can also seek legal recourse through the Philippine judicial system. Depending on the severity of the issue, buyers can file a complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or pursue a small claims case in the appropriate court. The DTI handles consumer complaints, especially those involving deceptive sales practices or violations of consumer protection laws. Filing a complaint with the DTI requires the buyer to submit documentary evidence of the transaction, such as receipts, screenshots, and communication logs.</p><p>Lastly, if the transaction involves significant financial loss or fraudulent activity, buyers may consider filing a criminal complaint with the Philippine National Police or the National Bureau of Investigation. These agencies can investigate the matter and file charges against the seller if warranted.</p><p>It is crucial for buyers to keep all relevant documentation and to act promptly when encountering issues with online transactions. Protecting consumer rights is paramount, and knowing the proper channels for complaints ensures that these rights are upheld.</p>
