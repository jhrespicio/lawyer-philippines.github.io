<p>In the Philippines, a co-maker is someone who guarantees the payment of a debt by signing a loan agreement alongside the principal borrower. As a co-maker, you share joint liability with the borrower. This means that if the borrower fails to pay the debt, the lender has the legal right to demand payment from you. The death of the principal borrower does not automatically absolve the co-maker from this responsibility.</p><p>However, if the principal borrower had an insurance policy that covered the debt, the insurance should ideally settle the outstanding balance upon the borrower's death. The co-maker may present this fact to the lending company as a defense against the demand for payment. It is crucial to review the terms of the loan agreement and the insurance policy. If the insurance policy explicitly covers the debt, the co-maker might not be liable, but this would require confirmation through legal advice.</p><p>Co-makers are advised to fully understand their obligations before signing any loan agreements. If faced with such a situation, consulting a lawyer is highly recommended to explore all possible legal options and ensure that your rights are protected.</p>
