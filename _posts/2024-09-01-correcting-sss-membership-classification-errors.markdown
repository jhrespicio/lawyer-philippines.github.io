<p>Members of the Social Security System (SSS) in the Philippines who discover errors in their membership classification, such as being incorrectly classified as a single proprietor instead of voluntary or self-employed, have the right to request corrections. To do so, the member should visit the nearest SSS branch and file a request for correction. The member will need to provide supporting documents, such as their SSS ID, the erroneous E-1 form, and any proof of their actual employment status during the period in question. The SSS will review the request and make the necessary adjustments to the member's record. It is important for members to address such errors promptly to ensure that their contributions are accurately recorded and that they receive the correct benefits upon retirement or in the event of disability or death.</p>
