<p>In the Philippines, individuals with pending criminal cases, such as estafa, are not explicitly barred from entering into business partnerships. However, the nature of the crime may raise concerns among potential business partners regarding trust and reliability. Estafa, being a crime involving deceit and financial malfeasance, can affect one's reputation and the willingness of others to engage in a business relationship. While there is no legal prohibition, the parties involved in forming a partnership must consider the potential risks and implications. Additionally, if convicted, certain civil interdictions may apply, potentially affecting the ability to participate in business activities.</p>
