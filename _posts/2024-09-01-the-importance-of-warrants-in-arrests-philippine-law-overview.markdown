<p>In the Philippines, the right against unlawful arrest is enshrined in the Constitution, which requires that arrests be made with a valid warrant of arrest. There are exceptions, such as when a person is caught in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto), when an arrest is made during the commission of a crime, or if there is probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime and is about to flee.</p><p>However, if an arrest is made without a warrant under circumstances that do not meet these exceptions, it may be deemed illegal, and the arrested individual may seek legal remedies, including filing for a writ of habeas corpus. The individual may also file a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) or seek redress through the courts.</p><p>Ensuring that arrests comply with legal standards is vital for protecting individual rights and upholding the rule of law in the country.</p>
