<p>GCash, a widely used mobile wallet in the Philippines, offers convenience for various transactions. However, disputes may arise when a payment is not refunded despite legitimate claims. In such cases, the user should first attempt to resolve the issue through GCash's customer service channels. If the matter remains unresolved, the user may consider filing a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which oversees financial institutions and electronic money issuers. It is also possible to seek legal redress by filing a small claims case in the appropriate court. The court process is designed to be straightforward, and legal representation is not required, making it accessible to individuals seeking to recover amounts from non-compliant entities. It is advisable to keep all documentation and communications related to the transaction as evidence when pursuing a refund through legal channels.</p>
