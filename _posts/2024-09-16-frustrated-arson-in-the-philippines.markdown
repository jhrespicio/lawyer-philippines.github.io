<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Is frustrated arson recognized as a crime in the Philippines?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Yes, frustrated arson is recognized under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. Arson involves the malicious burning of property. Frustrated arson occurs when the perpetrator has performed all the acts necessary to start the fire, but the intended outcome—such as destruction of property—is not accomplished due to reasons beyond their control. This is in contrast to consummated arson, where the intended damage occurs, and attempted arson, where the act is not completed. The penalties for frustrated arson vary depending on the extent of the damage and the specific circumstances of the crime.</p>
