<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I need to obtain an NBI clearance online, but I’ve forgotten my NBI ID number and no longer have a copy of it. Is there a way to get the clearance without it?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you’ve forgotten your NBI ID number, you can still proceed with the NBI clearance application online. The NBI ID number is not required to request a new clearance. Instead, you will need to provide personal details such as your full name, date of birth, and other identifying information when applying through the NBI Clearance website (https://clearance.nbi.gov.ph/). If you encounter issues, you may also visit the nearest NBI branch to retrieve your previous information. Bring valid identification and any supporting documents that may assist in locating your records.</p>
