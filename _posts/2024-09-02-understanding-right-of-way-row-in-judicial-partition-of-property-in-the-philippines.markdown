<p>In the context of judicial partition of property in the Philippines, the issue of right-of-way (ROW) often arises, especially in cases where a piece of land is subdivided among heirs or co-owners. The right-of-way refers to the legal right granted to a person or group to pass through another person's property, typically to access a public road or another property.</p><p>When property is divided through judicial partition, the court may establish a right-of-way to ensure that all subdivided portions of the property have access to essential services and roads. This ROW is typically shared by the co-owners and is considered a servitude on the property. However, ownership of the ROW remains with the individual or entity that holds the title to the underlying land, although it is subject to the rights of those who benefit from the ROW.</p><p>The establishment of a ROW must be registered with the Register of Deeds to ensure that it is legally recognized and enforceable against third parties. It is important to note that the ROW is usually for the benefit of the dominant estate (the property that needs access) and imposes a burden on the servient estate (the property through which the ROW passes).</p><p>Disputes regarding the width, location, or use of the ROW may be resolved through mediation or litigation, depending on the circumstances. It is advisable to consult a lawyer to navigate the complexities of ROW issues during judicial partition proceedings to ensure that the rights of all parties are adequately protected.</p>
