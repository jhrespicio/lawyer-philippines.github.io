<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I want to file an affidavit of desistance in court. Can you guide me on what steps I need to follow?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>An affidavit of desistance is a sworn statement indicating that the complainant wishes to discontinue the case. To file this, you must draft the affidavit, clearly stating your reasons for wanting to desist, and have it notarized. Once notarized, you need to file the affidavit with the court handling the case. It is important to note that while filing an affidavit of desistance may influence the dismissal of the case, the court is not obligated to grant dismissal, especially in criminal cases, where the decision rests with the court and the prosecutor. The court will evaluate whether there is sufficient merit to continue with the proceedings despite the desistance.</p>
