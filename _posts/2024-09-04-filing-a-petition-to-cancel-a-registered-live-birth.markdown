<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to file a petition to cancel a live birth that was registered erroneously. What are the legal steps to do this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><brTo cancel a registered live birth, you will need to file a petition for the cancellation of the birth record in court. This process involves demonstrating that the registration was made in error or is otherwise invalid. The petition must be filed in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) that has jurisdiction over the place where the birth was registered. You will need to present evidence such as the incorrect birth record, personal identification, and possibly the testimonies of witnesses. It is recommended to consult a lawyer to guide you through the legal proceedings and ensure all necessary documents are properly prepared.</p>
