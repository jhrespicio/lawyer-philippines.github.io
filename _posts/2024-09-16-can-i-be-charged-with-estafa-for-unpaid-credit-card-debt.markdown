<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have fallen behind on my credit card payments and recently enrolled in a debt aid program. However, I am concerned that the bank might file a case of estafa against me. Is this possible?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Generally, unpaid credit card debt alone is not enough to constitute estafa under Philippine law. Estafa involves fraud or deceit, such as knowingly misrepresenting your financial status or issuing checks without funds. As long as you did not obtain the credit card through fraudulent means, it is unlikely that the bank can charge you with estafa. They may, however, pursue civil remedies to collect the unpaid debt. It's advisable to keep communication open with the bank and honor the terms of any debt aid agreement you've entered into.</p>
