<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I was assaulted and have a medical certificate indicating a healing period of 3 to 5 days. Am I entitled to be paid for the days I missed work due to this incident?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine law, if the injury was work-related, you may be entitled to sickness benefits through the Social Security System (SSS) or your employer’s health insurance. If the injury was not work-related but you were unable to work due to the injury, your entitlement to paid leave depends on your company’s leave policies and your available leave credits. If your absence results in significant economic loss, you may also consider pursuing legal action against the assailant for damages, which could potentially include lost wages.</p>
