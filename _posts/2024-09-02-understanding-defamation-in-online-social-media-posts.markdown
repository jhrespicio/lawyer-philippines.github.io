<p>Defamation occurs when a statement that is false and injurious to another's reputation is made public. In the context of social media in the Philippines, posts or shared quotes that are perceived to pertain to a specific individual can lead to defamation charges if they harm that person's reputation. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, particularly under the provisions on libel, extends to online defamation, where a complainant can pursue legal action if they believe that a social media post is directed at them and is damaging. The burden of proof lies with the complainant to demonstrate that the post refers to them and that it has caused harm. Social media users should be mindful of the potential legal repercussions of their posts, especially if the content could be interpreted as defamatory, even in cases where the individual is not explicitly named.</p>
