<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> My husband owns a condo that is under his name, which he bought before we got married. Is this considered his separate property?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> In the Philippines, properties acquired before marriage are generally considered the exclusive property of the spouse who acquired them. Under the Family Code, any property owned by either spouse before the marriage remains their individual property, unless there is a pre-nuptial agreement that states otherwise. Therefore, the condo remains your husband's separate property, and you have no claim over it unless it becomes part of the conjugal or community property regime during the marriage through specific legal provisions.</p>
