<p>The turnover of condominium units in the Philippines is a significant event that marks the completion of the purchase process and the beginning of the owner's full possession of the property. However, delays in turnover are not uncommon and can lead to legal disputes between the developer and the buyer. Under the law, developers are generally bound by the terms of the contract, which should specify the turnover date. If the turnover is delayed, the buyer may be entitled to remedies, including compensation for the delay, penalties as stipulated in the contract, or even the cancellation of the contract with a full refund. The buyer should first review the contract to understand their rights and the developer's obligations. If negotiations fail, legal action may be necessary to enforce these rights. The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), now part of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD), can be approached for mediation or to file a formal complaint. The timely turnover of condominium units is essential for maintaining trust in the real estate market and ensuring that buyers receive the property they have paid for in accordance with the agreed timeline.</p>
