<p>When applying for a job in the Philippines, an employer may ask about past criminal convictions, which can include a conviction for unjust vexation or similar offenses. Under Philippine law, it is crucial to respond truthfully when asked about criminal convictions during the job application process. Misrepresentation or failure to disclose such information can be grounds for termination if discovered later. However, the Revised Penal Code and relevant jurisprudence provide that not all criminal convictions automatically disqualify a candidate from employment. Employers should also consider the relevance of the conviction to the job being applied for and whether the applicant has shown rehabilitation or good conduct since the conviction. Applicants may also consult legal counsel to better understand their rights and the implications of disclosing past convictions in job applications.</p>
