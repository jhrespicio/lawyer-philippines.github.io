<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I was hired as a Senior Developer, but I have been assigned managerial tasks without receiving the appropriate compensation or a promotion. This has been going on for almost two years. What are my options?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Under Philippine labor laws, an employer must compensate employees fairly for the work performed. If your actual duties significantly differ from your job description, and you are performing managerial tasks without proper recognition or compensation, you may have grounds to claim for wage differentials or demand a promotion in line with your responsibilities. It is best to raise this matter with your employer formally through a written request, detailing your duties and responsibilities. If the issue persists, you can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to address the situation. Consultation with a labor lawyer is also recommended to ensure that your rights are protected.</p>
