<p>In the Philippines, abuse of authority by employers is a serious issue that can significantly impact the welfare and rights of employees. Abuse of authority refers to situations where an employer misuses their power or position to exploit, intimidate, or unfairly treat employees. Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, employees are entitled to fair treatment, just compensation, and safe working conditions. Employers who cancel rest days or manipulate schedules to benefit themselves at the expense of their employees may be violating labor laws. Affected employees can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for investigation and redress. Furthermore, the law provides mechanisms for employees to seek justice through the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) if they believe their rights have been violated.</p>
