<p>Cohabitation, or living together without the benefit of marriage, is a common practice in the Philippines. However, legal issues may arise when individuals who have cohabited wish to marry someone else after the relationship ends. The Philippine Family Code governs these situations and provides guidelines on the legal implications of cohabitation and subsequent marriage.</p><p>Under Philippine law, cohabitation alone does not constitute a legal marriage, regardless of the duration of the relationship. This means that either party is free to marry another person once the cohabiting relationship has ended, provided that neither party is legally married to someone else. However, if either party is still legally married to another person, they must obtain a legal annulment or declaration of nullity of marriage before they can remarry.</p><p>Additionally, the law does not recognize common-law marriages, so any property acquired during the cohabitation must be divided according to the agreement of the parties or through legal proceedings if a dispute arises. It's also important to note that children born out of cohabitation are considered illegitimate unless the parents subsequently marry and acknowledge the children.</p><p>Individuals who wish to marry after cohabitation should ensure that all legal matters, such as the status of any previous marriages and property division, are resolved to avoid legal complications in the future.</p>
