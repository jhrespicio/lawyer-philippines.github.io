<p>A motion for reconsideration is a legal remedy available to students in the Philippines who have overstayed their allowed period in an academic institution. Overstaying can occur for various reasons, such as failing to meet academic requirements within the prescribed time. To file a motion for reconsideration, the student must submit a formal request to the institutionâ€™s relevant office, usually the registrar or the office handling student affairs. The motion should clearly state the reasons for the overstay and provide any supporting documentation that justifies the request for an extension. The institution will review the motion and decide based on its policies and regulations. It is crucial to file the motion promptly and ensure that all necessary documents are complete to improve the chances of approval.</p>
