<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am a person with a disability, and I have been bullied on social media. I want to file a cyber libel case against those responsible. What are my options?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Cyber libel is a punishable offense under the Philippine Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. If someone has posted defamatory statements about you online, you can file a criminal complaint for cyber libel. It is essential to gather evidence of the defamatory statements, such as screenshots or links to the posts, and identify the person responsible. The offense must meet the criteria for libel under the Revised Penal Code, including the requirement that the defamatory statement is made publicly, is malicious, and is aimed at discrediting or dishonoring you. As a person with a disability, you have the right to seek legal protection and remedy from any form of discrimination or harassment. Consulting with a lawyer experienced in cybercrime will help you navigate the legal process effectively.</p>
