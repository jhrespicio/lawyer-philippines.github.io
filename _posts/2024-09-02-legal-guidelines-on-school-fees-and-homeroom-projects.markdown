<p>In the Philippines, the collection of fees in schools, particularly for homeroom projects, is governed by specific regulations to ensure fairness and transparency. Both public and private schools must adhere to these guidelines to protect the rights of students and parents.</p><p><strong>1. Regulation of Fees:</strong> The Department of Education (DepEd) regulates the collection of fees in public schools. As a general rule, public schools are prohibited from collecting fees for any reason, including homeroom projects, during enrollment. However, voluntary contributions may be allowed for specific purposes, such as school activities or projects, but these must not be mandatory or a prerequisite for enrollment.</p><p><strong>2. Homeroom Projects:</strong> Homeroom projects are often initiated by teachers or parents to enhance the learning environment or provide additional resources for students. While these projects can benefit the school community, any associated costs should be discussed and agreed upon by the parents, and contributions must remain voluntary.</p><p><strong>3. Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Schools, through the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA), must ensure transparency in the collection and use of funds for homeroom projects. Detailed records should be maintained, and regular reports should be provided to parents to account for how the funds are used.</p><p><strong>4. Legal Protections for Students:</strong> Students should not be penalized or excluded from activities if their parents choose not to contribute to homeroom projects. The right to education is protected by law, and schools cannot impose additional financial burdens on students or parents beyond what is legally allowed.</p><p>Parents and educators are encouraged to communicate openly about the objectives and funding of homeroom projects to ensure that they align with educational goals and remain accessible to all students.</p>
