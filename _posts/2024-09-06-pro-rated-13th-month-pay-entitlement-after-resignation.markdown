<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I resigned from my company with my effective resignation date falling between May 15 to May 30. It has been three months since I left, and I still havenâ€™t received my pro-rated 13th month pay. My employer has claimed that I am no longer entitled to receive it, but I believe that I should still be paid. What are my rights regarding this matter?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine labor laws, employees who resign before the end of the calendar year are entitled to a pro-rated 13th month pay, calculated based on the number of months they have worked during the year. Employers cannot withhold this pay unless there is a valid and lawful reason. You may formally request in writing for the company to provide you with your 13th month pay or ask for an explanation if they refuse. If no resolution is reached, you can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for them to mediate and enforce your entitlement to the pro-rated 13th month pay.</p>
