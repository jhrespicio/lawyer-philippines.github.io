<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My spouse hacked into my account and is now using it to blackmail me. What legal actions can I take in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>This situation can be categorized as a cybercrime under the Philippine Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). Hacking into someoneâ€™s account without permission constitutes illegal access under the law, and blackmailing is considered a form of cyber extortion. You may file a complaint with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group. It is advisable to gather all evidence, such as screenshots of the blackmail, and present them when filing your complaint. Legal remedies may also include filing for protection orders if there is a threat of harm or harassment.</p>
