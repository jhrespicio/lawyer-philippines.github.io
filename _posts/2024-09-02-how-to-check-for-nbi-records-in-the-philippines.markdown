<p>In the Philippines, individuals can verify if they have any criminal records or clearance issues by requesting a National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance. The NBI clearance is a document that certifies whether an individual has a criminal record or is clear of any derogatory information. This process is commonly required for employment, travel, and other legal purposes. To obtain an NBI clearance, one must go through an online application process, schedule an appointment, and visit an NBI office for biometric data capture and verification. Once issued, the clearance will indicate whether or not the individual has any records with the NBI. It is important to note that the NBI clearance is only valid for one year and must be renewed if needed for ongoing legal or professional purposes.</p>
