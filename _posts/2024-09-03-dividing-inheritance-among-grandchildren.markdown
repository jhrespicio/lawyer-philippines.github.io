<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My grandparents had seven children, and only one is still alive. The other six have passed away, leaving 22 grandchildren. How should we divide the inheritance among ourselves?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, inheritance distribution follows the rules laid out in the Civil Code, specifically the rules of intestate succession. Since your grandparents passed away and assuming there is no will, the inheritance should first be divided among their children. In this case, the inheritance would typically be divided into seven parts. The surviving child will receive one part, while the share of each deceased child will be further divided among their respective heirs (the grandchildren). Since you mentioned there are 22 grandchildren, the distribution will depend on how many children each deceased sibling had. It's recommended to seek legal counsel to ensure the distribution is done according to the law, especially if there are complications or disputes among the heirs.</p>
