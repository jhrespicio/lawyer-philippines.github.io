<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I want to file a case against someone for cyberbullying. Is it necessary to go through barangay mediation before formally filing the case in court?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, certain disputes between private individuals, such as minor altercations or neighborhood disagreements, are first handled through barangay mediation under the Katarungang Pambarangay Law (Presidential Decree No. 1508). However, cyberbullying cases are different, as they often involve more serious harm or threats carried out through digital platforms.</p><p>Because cyberbullying involves harassment and may cause significant emotional or psychological harm, it is usually treated as a criminal offense under the Cybercrime Prevention Act. In such cases, barangay mediation may not be necessary, and you can directly file a complaint with the police or the NBI. If the offense involves minors, the case may also be handled under Republic Act No. 10627 (Anti-Bullying Act of 2013) for school-related incidents.</p>
