<p>In the Philippines, long-term tenants, particularly those who have worked the land for decades, may have certain rights under agrarian reform laws if the land they are occupying is sold. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) provides mechanisms to protect tenants and farmworkers from being unjustly displaced. Under CARP, tenants who have tilled the land for a significant period may be entitled to benefits such as preferential rights to purchase the land or to receive compensation. Additionally, tenants may be eligible for land redistribution programs, where they can be awarded the land they have cultivated, subject to specific criteria and government processes. It is crucial for tenants to seek legal advice and engage with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to understand their rights and any potential benefits they might be entitled to if the land they have been working on is sold.</p>
