<p>The 13th month pay is a mandatory benefit in the Philippines, guaranteed to all rank-and-file employees regardless of the nature of their employment. This includes construction workers who are hired through contractors for project-based work. Under Presidential Decree No. 851, all employers are required to provide their employees with a 13th month pay, equivalent to one-twelfth of the employeeâ€™s total basic salary within a calendar year.</p><p>For construction workers employed by a contractor, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that the 13th month pay is provided, even if the work is for a specific project. The contractor, being the direct employer, must comply with this legal obligation, regardless of the project's duration or the nature of the contractual arrangement.</p><p>If a construction worker believes that they have not received their rightful 13th month pay, they can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The DOLE has the authority to investigate the claim and ensure that the contractor fulfills their obligation. It is important for both workers and contractors to be aware of this requirement to avoid legal disputes and ensure fair treatment in the workplace.</p>
