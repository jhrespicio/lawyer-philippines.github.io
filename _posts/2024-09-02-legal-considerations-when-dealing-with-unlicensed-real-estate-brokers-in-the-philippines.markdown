<p>In the Philippines, the practice of real estate brokerage is regulated by the Real Estate Service Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9646), which requires individuals engaged in the sale, lease, or management of real estate properties to be licensed by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). Engaging in real estate transactions with an unlicensed broker can lead to legal complications and potential financial losses.</p><p>If a party discovers that they are dealing with an unlicensed real estate broker, they have the right to terminate the transaction and seek the return of any payments made, such as earnest money or down payments. It is advisable to request the unlicensed broker to sign an undertaking to return the funds by a specified deadline. If the broker fails to comply, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the PRC and seek legal remedies through civil action for the recovery of the amount paid.</p><p>In cases where a check issued by the unlicensed broker bounces, the aggrieved party may also file a criminal complaint for violation of the Bouncing Checks Law (Batas Pambansa Bilang 22). This law penalizes the act of issuing a check without sufficient funds, and the issuer can face imprisonment or fines if found guilty.</p><p>To avoid such issues, it is crucial to verify the credentials of any real estate broker before entering into a transaction. The PRC provides an online verification system where individuals can check the license status of real estate professionals. Ensuring that a broker is duly licensed helps protect the interests of all parties involved in real estate transactions.</p>
