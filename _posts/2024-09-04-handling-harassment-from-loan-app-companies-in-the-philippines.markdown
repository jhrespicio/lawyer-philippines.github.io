<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I have a significant amount of debt with a loan app, and I can no longer pay even the interest. The messages and calls from them have become increasingly stressful and threatening. What are my legal options in this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Debt collectors in the Philippines, including loan apps, are required to follow ethical and legal guidelines in their collection practices. If you are facing harassment, you have legal rights to protect yourself:</p><ul><li><strong>Harassment is illegal:</strong> Under Philippine laws, harassment through text messages, calls, and threats can be classified as unfair debt collection practices. The <em>Revised Penal Code</em> or laws on unfair debt collection can be cited to protect you from abusive collection methods.</li><li><strong>Grave threats and intimidation:</strong> You may file a complaint against the loan app or their agents for grave threats or intimidation, particularly if the messages contain threats of harm or unlawful actions.</li><li><strong>Seek mediation:</strong> If you are unable to settle your debt, you may request mediation from the appropriate regulatory body, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), if the loan app is under their jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>File a complaint with the NPC:</strong> If the loan app violates your data privacy (e.g., using your contacts without permission), you can file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC).</li></ul><p>Consult a lawyer to help you evaluate all available legal remedies and consider negotiating with the loan company to restructure the debt.</p>
