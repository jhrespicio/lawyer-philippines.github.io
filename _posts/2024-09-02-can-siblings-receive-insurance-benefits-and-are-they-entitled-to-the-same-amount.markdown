<p>In the Philippines, the distribution of insurance benefits, particularly in cases where the insured has passed away, depends on several factors, including the specific terms outlined in the insurance policy and applicable laws. Siblings can potentially receive benefits from an insurance policy, but this typically hinges on whether they are named as beneficiaries in the policy.</p><p>If the siblings are designated as beneficiaries, the amount they receive may vary based on the instructions provided by the policyholder. The policyholder can specify whether the benefits are to be distributed equally among the siblings or in different proportions. In the absence of such instructions, the insurance company will distribute the benefits according to the policyâ€™s terms or applicable law, which may result in equal distribution.</p><p>It is also important to note that if the policyholder did not designate any beneficiaries or if the designated beneficiaries predeceased the insured, the insurance proceeds would be distributed according to the rules of succession under the Civil Code of the Philippines. In such cases, siblings might be entitled to a share of the insurance benefits, depending on the surviving heirs and their relationship to the deceased.</p><p>For specific advice or clarification regarding the distribution of insurance benefits, it is recommended to consult with an insurance expert or a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the details of the policy and the circumstances of the case.</p>
