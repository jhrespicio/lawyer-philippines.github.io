<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Can a landowner legally block access to a right of way that I’ve been using to access my property?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under the Civil Code of the Philippines, a right of way is considered a legal easement if it is necessary for access to one’s property, especially if your property is enclosed and has no adequate outlet to a public road. The owner of the property who benefits from the easement (the dominant estate) has the right to use the right of way, and the owner of the land on which the easement is located (the servient estate) cannot block or restrict access unless there is a valid legal reason. If the right of way is blocked, you can file an action for injunction or file a complaint before the courts to enforce your legal right to access. It is advisable to first resolve this issue amicably, but if that fails, legal remedies are available to enforce the easement.</p>
