<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to ask if an employee's health card should be held by the agency or by the employee whose name is on the card?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, a health card issued as part of employment benefits is generally considered the personal property of the employee whose name appears on the card. Therefore, the health card should be held and managed by the employee, not by the agency or employer.</p><p>The employee has the right to possess and use the health card according to its terms and conditions, including accessing healthcare services from accredited providers. The agency or employer may require copies of the health card for administrative purposes, but they should not withhold the card itself.</p><p>If an employer or agency refuses to release the health card to the employee, the employee can request its return in writing. If the issue is not resolved, the employee may seek assistance from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to enforce their right to possess the health card.</p>
