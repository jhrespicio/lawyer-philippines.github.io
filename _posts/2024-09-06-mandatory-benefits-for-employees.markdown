<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>Could you provide clarification on mandatory benefits that employers are required to provide to employees in the Philippines?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor laws, employees are entitled to several mandatory benefits. These include 13th-month pay, Social Security System (SSS) contributions, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) contributions, and Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG) contributions. Additionally, employees are entitled to rest days, service incentive leave, and overtime pay under certain conditions. Employers are required by law to ensure that these benefits are provided to regular, probationary, and casual employees alike. Failure to comply with mandatory benefits could result in penalties for the employer, as stipulated by the Labor Code of the Philippines.</p>
