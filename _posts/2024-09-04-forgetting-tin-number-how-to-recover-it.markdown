<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I seem to have forgotten my TIN (Tax Identification Number) and donâ€™t know where I have recorded it. How can I retrieve my TIN?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) handles the issuance and recovery of TINs. To recover a lost or forgotten TIN, you can visit any BIR branch and request for TIN verification. Bring valid identification such as a government-issued ID, and they can provide you with your TIN.</p><p>If visiting a BIR office in person is inconvenient, you may also try contacting their hotline or email them through their official channels. Some online services and apps affiliated with the BIR may also offer TIN recovery, but these should be used with caution to ensure data security.</p><p>Do note that each person is only allowed one TIN. If a new one is mistakenly issued, it could cause complications with your tax records. Make sure to handle the matter promptly to avoid any issues.</p>
