<p>Dear Attorney,</p><p>I have already finalized my divorce through the PSA and Sharia court. I would like to know if I am now allowed to remarry under Philippine law, as I am planning to do so. Could you provide clarity on whether this is legally permissible?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine law, remarriage after divorce is generally not allowed, as the Philippines does not recognize divorce except for Muslim Filipinos under the Code of Muslim Personal Laws. If your divorce has been granted under Sharia court, you may remarry, but you must ensure that the proper legal processes have been completed. Additionally, it is crucial that the divorce be recognized by the Philippine government, especially if the remarriage is outside the Muslim community. Consulting with your lawyer and the relevant authorities can help ensure you follow the correct steps.</p>
