<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br/>I would like to ask about the demand and ultimatum letter my aunt and father received. It was a photocopy and lacked a dry seal. Is this legitimate?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br/>In the Philippines, a legal demand letter does not require a dry seal to be considered valid. What is crucial is the content of the letter, the signature of the party or lawyer issuing it, and whether it clearly expresses a legal demand or warning. The fact that it is a photocopy does not automatically invalidate it, but it raises questions about the authenticity of the document. It is advisable to check if the sender is a legitimate entity or law firm and verify the letter's source. If you doubt its legitimacy, consult a lawyer for further evaluation and advice.</p>
