<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have been filing reports with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for several consecutive years without a break. Is it fair for lawyers to be required to file BIR reports continuously without taking a break?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>While the filing of BIR returns is a legal obligation for professionals like lawyers, there is no legal provision that allows professionals to take a 'break' from tax filing requirements, as these are part of the regular obligations for tax compliance. However, if you are finding the process overly burdensome, you may consider working with an accountant or tax professional to help manage your tax filing obligations. Furthermore, electronic filing systems and services offered by the BIR can make the filing process more efficient. The law mandates regular compliance to ensure accountability and proper record-keeping, which benefits both the taxpayer and the government.</p>
