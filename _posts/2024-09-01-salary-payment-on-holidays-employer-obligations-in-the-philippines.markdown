<p>In the Philippines, the payment of salaries on time is mandated by law. According to the Labor Code, wages should be paid directly to the workers and must be paid in intervals not exceeding 16 days. However, when payday falls on a holiday, it does not automatically justify a delay in salary payment. Employers are expected to ensure that employees receive their wages on the designated payday, even if it coincides with a holiday.</p><p>If there is a delay in salary payment due to a holiday, employees can report this to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Employers must exercise diligence in ensuring that their payroll systems can accommodate such situations to avoid violating the law.</p>
