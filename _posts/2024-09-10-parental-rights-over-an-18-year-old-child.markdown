<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I am an overseas Filipino worker (seafarer), and although I provide financial support, I am not allowed to spend time with my 18-year-old child. Is there a law that allows or restricts this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine law, a child who has reached the age of 18 is legally considered an adult. The rights and obligations concerning child custody and visitation generally cease when the child reaches the age of majority. However, the child's preference plays a significant role once they are of legal age, and they are free to choose who they want to associate with. If there are concerns about unfair restrictions, a parent may still petition the court for legal guidance or try to reconcile the issue through family mediation. The Family Code of the Philippines (Article 211) emphasizes that parental authority is intended for the benefit of the child, and by 18, such authority transitions largely into personal choices by the child.</p>
