<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recently noticed a fraudulent transaction on my bank account. I did not authorize this transaction and have already reported it to my bank, but they seem to be delaying their investigation. What should be my next steps to ensure this is addressed promptly, and can I take legal action against the bank if they fail to resolve the issue?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you suspect a fraudulent transaction, you have the right to report it to your bank immediately and request an investigation. Under Philippine law, particularly the BSP regulations, banks are obligated to protect consumers from unauthorized transactions. If the bank does not act within a reasonable time, you may file a complaint with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or pursue legal action for damages. Ensure that you keep records of your communication with the bank for evidence, should it be necessary.</p>
