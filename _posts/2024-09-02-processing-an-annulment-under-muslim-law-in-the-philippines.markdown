<p>Annulment under Muslim law in the Philippines is governed by the <em>Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No. 1083)</em>. This special law applies to Filipino Muslims and provides for the annulment of marriage based on specific grounds such as impotence, insanity, fraud, or coercion. Unlike civil annulments, which are handled by regular courts, annulments under Muslim law are adjudicated by the <em>Shari'a District Courts</em>.</p><p>The process begins with the filing of a petition by the aggrieved party in the appropriate Shari'a court. After filing, the court sets a date for the hearing and may require the presence of witnesses and submission of documentary evidence to support the claim. The court will then render a decision based on the evidence presented.</p><p>The duration of the annulment process under Muslim law varies depending on the complexity of the case, the cooperation of the parties involved, and the efficiency of the court. While some cases may be resolved within a few months, others could take years. It is important for individuals seeking annulment under Muslim law to consult with a knowledgeable lawyer who specializes in Shari'a law to guide them through the process and ensure that all legal requirements are met.</p>
