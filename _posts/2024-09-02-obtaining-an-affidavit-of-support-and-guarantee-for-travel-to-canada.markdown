<p>An Affidavit of Support and Guarantee is a document required by Canadian immigration authorities as part of the visa application process for tourists. This document serves as a formal declaration by a sponsor, typically a relative or close friend residing in Canada, stating their commitment to support the applicant financially during their stay and ensure compliance with Canadian laws. To obtain this affidavit, the sponsor must prepare the document and have it notarized, providing proof of financial capability, such as bank statements or employment certificates, to substantiate their ability to fulfill the financial obligations. The affidavit must also include a clear statement of the relationship between the sponsor and the applicant, as well as the purpose and duration of the visit. It is important to ensure that all information provided is accurate and truthful, as any discrepancies could result in the denial of the visa application or legal consequences for both the sponsor and the applicant.</p>
