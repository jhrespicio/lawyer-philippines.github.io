<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>A friend of mine, who is an Indian national, wants to start a business in the Philippines. What business opportunities would you recommend for him?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under Philippine law, foreign nationals may invest in and operate businesses, subject to certain restrictions under the Foreign Investments Act of 1991. The law allows foreigners to fully own businesses in sectors where 100% foreign ownership is permitted, such as export-oriented enterprises or businesses with paid-in capital of at least USD 200,000. Alternatively, your friend could enter into a partnership or corporation with Filipino citizens, depending on the nature of the business. Popular sectors for foreign investors include IT-BPO services, manufacturing, and food and beverage franchises. However, certain industries, like retail, are restricted to 60% Filipino ownership. Consulting with a local business lawyer can help your friend navigate these laws and find the best options based on his interests and financial capacity.</p>
