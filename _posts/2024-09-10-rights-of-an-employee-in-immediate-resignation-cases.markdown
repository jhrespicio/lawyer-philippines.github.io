<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My husband tried to submit an immediate resignation, but the company did not allow him to do so. His contract had already expired on December 27, 2023, and there were issues with delayed salaries. The company is now refusing to release his final salary unless he continues working. What can we do about this situation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor law, an employee may resign immediately in certain justified situations, such as non-payment of salary or serious breach of the employment contract by the employer. If your husbandâ€™s contract has already expired, the employer has no right to compel him to continue working. Additionally, withholding salaries due to an employee's resignation is unlawful. Your husband can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for the non-payment of wages and the illegal withholding of his final pay. DOLE has the authority to enforce labor laws and ensure that employers comply with wage-related obligations.</p>
