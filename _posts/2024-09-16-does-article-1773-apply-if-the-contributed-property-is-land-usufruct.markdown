<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have a question regarding a partnership where a piece of land usufruct is being contributed. Would Article 1773 of the Civil Code still apply if the property being contributed is a usufruct, not the actual land?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Article 1773 of the Civil Code of the Philippines states that a contract of partnership is void if an immovable property is contributed without an inventory being made, signed by the parties, and attached to the public instrument. A usufruct, which is the right to use and enjoy the benefits of someone else's property, still pertains to immovable property. Therefore, Article 1773 would still apply if the usufruct of land is contributed, as the usufruct is still considered an interest in immovable property, requiring proper documentation.</p>
