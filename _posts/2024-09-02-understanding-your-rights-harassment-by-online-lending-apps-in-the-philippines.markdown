<p>Online lending apps have gained popularity in the Philippines, offering quick and easy access to loans. However, some users have reported experiencing harassment from these companies, particularly when they are unable to make timely payments. It is important to know that while lending companies have the right to collect debts, they must do so within the bounds of the law. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulate these practices. Harassment, including threats, public shaming, or contacting your friends and relatives to pressure you into paying, is illegal. If you are experiencing harassment, you can file a complaint with the BSP or the SEC. Additionally, it is advisable to communicate directly with the lending company to negotiate a payment plan or seek legal advice to understand your options. Remember that responsible borrowing and prompt payment are crucial to avoiding such situations.</p>
