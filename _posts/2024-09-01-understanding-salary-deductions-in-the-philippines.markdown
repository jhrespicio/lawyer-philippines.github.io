These include deductions for contributions to government-mandated benefits such as the Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and the Pag-IBIG Fund. Other allowable deductions include those for tax withholdings, union dues, and other items authorized by law or by the employee&#39;s written consent.</p><p>It is crucial for employees to understand that unauthorized or arbitrary deductions are prohibited. Employers cannot deduct amounts for losses, damages, or shortages without the employee&#39;s written consent and due process.
