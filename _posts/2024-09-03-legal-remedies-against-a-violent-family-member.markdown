<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My brother has been an alcoholic for many years, and he often becomes violent when drunk. He now poses a danger to my family, especially my children. What legal action can I take to protect us?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In situations like this, you can seek protection under the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act (Republic Act No. 9262) if the violence or threats are directed toward you or your children. You may file a Barangay Protection Order (BPO) or a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) in court, which can include prohibitions on contact and proximity. Additionally, you may report the violent behavior to the local authorities, who can take further action, such as arresting your brother if the behavior warrants it. Legal counsel can guide you through these processes to ensure your familyâ€™s safety.</p>
