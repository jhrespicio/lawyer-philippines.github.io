<p>When someone you trust fails to return money that was promised to be repaid or doubled, it can be a frustrating and legally complex situation. In the Philippines, you have the option to file a legal case for the recovery of money based on breach of contract or estafa (swindling). The first step is to demand the repayment in writing, specifying the amount owed and the due date. If the person still fails to pay, you can file a complaint with the barangay where the person resides to initiate mediation. If mediation fails, you can escalate the matter to the courts. It is important to gather all relevant evidence, such as written agreements, receipts, or any communication that proves the arrangement. Legal action should be pursued as soon as possible to avoid complications in the recovery process.</p>
