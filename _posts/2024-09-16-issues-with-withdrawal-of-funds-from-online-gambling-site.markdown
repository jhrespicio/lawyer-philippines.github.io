<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I deposited a significant amount of money into an online gambling platform, but I cannot withdraw my funds. The platform claims I need to complete a 'last purchase' before I can withdraw. Is this legal, and what actions can I take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Online gambling, unless authorized and regulated by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) or other government agencies, may be illegal in the Philippines. Platforms operating without proper licenses are considered unlawful, and any transactions with them can be questionable. If the platform you are using is unregulated, you may face difficulties in recovering your funds, as these sites often operate outside the legal framework. It is advisable to cease further transactions and report the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Cybercrime Unit for further investigation. Always verify if the gambling site is licensed before making any transactions.</p>
