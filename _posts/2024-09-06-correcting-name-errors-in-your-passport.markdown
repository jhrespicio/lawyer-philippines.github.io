<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My government IDs and birth certificate list 'JR' as part of my last name, but my passport lists 'JR' in my given name. Do I need to follow the name format in my passport?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>It is important to ensure consistency in your name across all official documents, especially in your passport, as it serves as a primary form of identification. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) follows strict guidelines when issuing passports and will generally use the name format found in your birth certificate issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). If there is a discrepancy between your passport and other documents, you may need to file for a correction with the DFA. To do this, you will need to present your original PSA birth certificate and a letter of request. Correcting the name ensures that future transactions with both government and private institutions proceed smoothly.</p>
