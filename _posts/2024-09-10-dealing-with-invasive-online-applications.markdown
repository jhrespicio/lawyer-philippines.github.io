<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I installed an online application that charges a 50% fee for seven days of usage and invades my phoneâ€™s privacy. Is there any legal action I can take against this application for these violations?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012 in the Philippines, any entity that collects personal information must obtain the explicit consent of the individual and must not misuse the data. If an online application invades your phone's privacy by accessing personal information without your consent, this constitutes a violation of your privacy rights. You can report the app to the National Privacy Commission (NPC) for investigation. In addition, if the fees were not clearly disclosed before usage, you may also have grounds for a complaint under consumer protection laws. It is advisable to uninstall the app and take immediate steps to secure your personal data.</p>
