<p>In the Philippines, the practice of teachers soliciting donations in exchange for additional grades or academic points is highly questionable and potentially illegal. The Department of Education (DepEd) strictly prohibits any form of bribery or unethical practices that compromise the integrity of the educational system. Teachers hold a position of trust and are expected to uphold fairness and objectivity in grading students. Soliciting donations in return for academic favors can be construed as a violation of the Code of Ethics for Professional Teachers, which mandates teachers to provide unbiased assessments of student performance. Moreover, such actions could be seen as a violation of anti-corruption laws, specifically the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act No. 3019). Therefore, teachers should avoid engaging in any activities that could undermine their professional responsibilities and the educational system&#39;s integrity.</p>
