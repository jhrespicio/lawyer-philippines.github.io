<p>Cyberbullying, a serious issue in the digital age, is increasingly becoming a concern in the Philippines. The government, recognizing the gravity of the situation, has enacted laws to combat cyberbullying and provide protection to victims. The most pertinent law is the <em>Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012</em> (Republic Act No. 10175), which criminalizes cyberbullying under its provisions on libel and other computer-related offenses.</p><p>Under this law, cyberbullying can be prosecuted as cyber libel if it involves defamatory statements made online that damage the reputation of an individual. Convictions can result in imprisonment ranging from six months to up to six years, and fines that depend on the court's discretion, based on the extent of the harm caused.</p><p>Moreover, schools and institutions are encouraged to implement anti-bullying policies under the <em>Anti-Bullying Act of 2013</em> (Republic Act No. 10627). Although this law primarily targets traditional forms of bullying, its application extends to cyberbullying incidents occurring within school environments. Offenders, particularly minors, may be subjected to disciplinary actions such as suspension, counseling, or other measures deemed appropriate by the school administration.</p><p>Cyberbullying victims are urged to gather evidence of the harassment, such as screenshots and message logs, to support their case. They can file complaints with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group for further action. Legal recourse is also available through civil suits for damages caused by the bullying.</p>
