<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to know how much it will cost to have a clerical error corrected in a birth certificate or other civil documents. What is the process for this, and how long does it take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>The process for correcting a clerical error in civil documents such as birth certificates is governed by Republic Act No. 9048, also known as the Clerical Error Law. Under this law, clerical or typographical errors in civil registry documents can be corrected without the need for a judicial order.</p><p>You may file a petition for correction with the Local Civil Registrar where the document was registered. The process generally involves submitting the necessary documents, including proof of the error and identification. The Local Civil Registrar will assess the application and make the correction if the petition is approved.</p><p>Costs for this process vary depending on the locality, but they generally include filing fees and certification costs. The timeline can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the complexity of the error and the efficiency of the local civil registrar's office. Itâ€™s advisable to inquire with the local civil registry for the specific fees and processing times in your area.</p>
