<p>In the Philippines, the validity of a last will and testament is governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines. A will is a legal document that expresses the wishes of a person (testator) regarding the distribution of their property after death. For a will to be valid, it must comply with certain formalities as required by law.</p><p>A last will and testament must be in writing and signed by the testator, or by another person in the testator&#39;s presence and under the testator&#39;s express direction. It must also be attested and subscribed by at least three credible witnesses in the presence of the testator and each other. These witnesses must also attest to the testator’s capacity to make the will, and the proper execution of the will.</p><p>In cases where the will intends to give the testator&#39;s share of the inheritance to a specific person, such as a nephew or niece, it must be clearly stated in the will. However, it is important to note that the right of compulsory heirs, such as children and spouses, to their legitime—a portion of the estate that cannot be freely disposed of by the testator—must be respected.</p><p>If a compulsory heir has predeceased the testator, their share typically passes to their descendants. If the will does not respect the legitime of the compulsory heirs, it may be declared void in that respect. Thus, while a testator can designate a specific heir in their will, the disposition must still conform to the limitations set by law.</p>
