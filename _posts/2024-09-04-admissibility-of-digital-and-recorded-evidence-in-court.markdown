What preliminary matters must be established for these types of evidence to be admissible in court?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>For digital and recorded evidence to be admissible in court in the Philippines, several preliminary matters must be established:<br>1. <strong>Authentication</strong>: You must prove that the evidence is genuine and accurately represents what it purports to show. This may involve presenting witnesses who can testify to the authenticity of the material.<br>2. <strong>Relevance</strong>: The evidence must be relevant to the case at hand, meaning it must have a direct bearing on the issues being decided.<br>3. <strong>Integrity of Chain of Custody</strong>: Especially for digital evidence, it is important to establish a clear and uninterrupted chain of custody to ensure that the evidence has not been tampered with.<br>4. <strong>Compliance with Rules on Documentary Evidence</strong>: Photographs, videos, and digital data are considered documentary evidence and must comply with the best evidence rule, which often requires that the original or primary source be presented unless a valid exception applies.<br>5. <strong>Data Privacy and Consent</strong>: For recordings involving private communications, you must ensure that consent was obtained from the parties involved; otherwise, the evidence may be inadmissible under the Anti-Wiretapping Act.<br>Meeting these requirements is crucial to ensuring that the evidence is not challenged and excluded in court proceedings.</p>
