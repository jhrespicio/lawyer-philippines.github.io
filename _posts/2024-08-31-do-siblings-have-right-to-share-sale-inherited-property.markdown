**Question:** If a parent sells an inherited property, do the siblings have the right to share in the proceeds?

Under Philippine law, the distribution of an estate, including inherited properties, is governed by the rules of succession in the Civil Code. When a parent inherits a property, it becomes part of their personal estate. As such, the property can generally be disposed of by the parent during their lifetime, including selling it, without requiring the consent of their children.

However, it is crucial to consider whether the property in question was subject to any conditions or stipulations that would prevent its sale, such as being specifically reserved for future generations or designated for another purpose by the original owner. In the absence of such stipulations, the parent has the legal right to sell the property.

Once the property is sold, the proceeds from the sale belong to the parent. The children do not have an automatic right to a share of the proceeds unless the parent chooses to distribute it to them. It is important to distinguish between the sale of the property during the parent’s lifetime and the distribution of the estate upon the parent’s death. If the property is still part of the estate at the time of the parent’s death, it would be subject to the rules of inheritance, where the siblings would have their respective shares.

In conclusion, siblings do not have a legal right to claim a share of the proceeds from the sale of an inherited property if it is sold by the parent who inherited it, provided there are no legal stipulations preventing the sale.
