<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I paid a security deposit to my landlady, but I’m moving out and she refuses to refund it. She says it’s consumable, but I can’t consume it since I’m leaving. I suggested using the deposit for my utility bills, but she rejected the idea. Can I be made to pay more?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the rights and obligations of both the landlord and tenant are usually governed by the rental agreement. If the deposit is labeled as consumable, it typically means it can be used to cover unpaid rent, damages, or utility bills. However, if you have no outstanding debts or damages and the deposit was not consumed for its intended purpose during the rental period, the landlady should refund it. If negotiations with the landlady fail, you may file a complaint with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) or in the Barangay for mediation. If needed, small claims court may be an option, but legal advice should be sought for specific guidance on the process.</p>
