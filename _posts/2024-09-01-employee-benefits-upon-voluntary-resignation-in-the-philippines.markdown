<p>In the Philippines, employees who voluntarily resign are typically not entitled to the same benefits as those who are terminated involuntarily. However, there are certain benefits that a resigning employee may still receive. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Final Pay:</strong> This includes the employee's unpaid salary, prorated 13th-month pay, and any unused leave credits. The computation of final pay may also include other benefits stipulated in the employment contract.</li><li><strong>Separation Pay:</strong> Generally, separation pay is not granted to employees who resign voluntarily unless it is stipulated in the company policy or the employment contract. Separation pay is typically reserved for cases of redundancy, retrenchment, or illegal dismissal.</li><li><strong>Certificate of Employment (COE):</strong> Employers are obliged to provide a certificate of employment upon request, indicating the period of employment and the nature of the work performed.</li><li><strong>Government-Mandated Benefits:</strong> Resigning employees are still entitled to receive government-mandated benefits such as Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG contributions, which should be remitted by the employer during the period of employment.</li></ul><p>It is important for employees to review their employment contracts and company policies to understand their entitlements upon resignation. Consulting with the company's HR department or a legal professional is also advisable to ensure all rights are fully understood and exercised.</p>
