<p>In the Philippines, establishing paternity is a crucial step in determining a father's legal obligations, including child support. When a father is uncertain about his paternity, he has the right to request a DNA test to establish whether he is the biological parent of the child. This is particularly important if the child uses the surname of another man, or if there are doubts about the child's parentage due to the mother’s relationships. Once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide support for the child, regardless of the child's surname or whether the father has recognized the child legally. Support may include financial assistance for the child’s basic needs, education, and healthcare. Fathers are encouraged to seek legal clarity and ensure that any support provided is documented to protect their rights and fulfill their obligations under the law. It is also advisable to consult with a legal professional to navigate the complexities of paternity and child support issues in the Philippines.</p>
