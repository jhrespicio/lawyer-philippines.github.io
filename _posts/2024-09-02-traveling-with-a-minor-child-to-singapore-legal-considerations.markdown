<p>When planning to travel abroad with a minor child, such as to Singapore, it is important to understand the legal requirements and considerations involved. In the Philippines, both parents are required to provide consent for a minor to travel abroad if the child is traveling with only one parent or a guardian. This consent is typically in the form of a notarized affidavit of consent or a Special Power of Attorney. Additionally, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) may require a Travel Clearance for minors traveling abroad if the child is traveling alone or with someone other than a parent. This clearance ensures that the child's travel is lawful and that their welfare is protected. It is important to ensure that all necessary documents are prepared and authenticated to avoid issues at immigration and ensure a smooth travel experience.</p>
