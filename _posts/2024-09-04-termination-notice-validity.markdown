<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I recently received a notice of termination from my employer. How can I verify if this notice is valid and complies with the law?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>A notice of termination must comply with specific legal requirements in the Philippines. According to the Labor Code, an employee can only be terminated for just or authorized causes. For just causes, such as misconduct or neglect of duties, the employer must provide a written notice stating the grounds for termination and allow the employee to respond. For authorized causes, like redundancy or retrenchment, due process must be followed, including a 30-day prior notice. If the notice fails to comply with these requirements, it may be deemed invalid, and you may contest it with the DOLE or through a labor court.</p>
