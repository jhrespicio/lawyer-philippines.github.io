<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>The barangay captain frequently delays the schedules he sets for meetings and other activities. What can be done about this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under the Local Government Code of the Philippines, barangay officials, including barangay captains, are expected to perform their duties efficiently and in a timely manner. If a barangay captain repeatedly delays activities and it negatively affects the community, residents can file a complaint with the local government or the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). Barangay captains are public officials, and they are held accountable for their actions or inactions. You can also bring the issue up during barangay assembly meetings, as these are venues for community concerns. For repeated delays causing substantial disruptions, filing an administrative complaint may be warranted.</p>
