<p>In the Philippines, legitimation is the process by which a child born out of wedlock is granted the status of legitimacy when the parents subsequently marry. This process is crucial for securing the legal rights and privileges of the child, such as inheritance rights and the use of the father's surname. To initiate legitimation, the parents must submit a joint affidavit of legitimation to the local civil registrar, along with a copy of the child's birth certificate and the parents' marriage certificate. If the child is of legal age (18 years old or above), their consent is also required. Typically, the parents should be present when filing these documents, although in certain circumstances, their absence can be accommodated through a special power of attorney. Once the legitimation is processed, the child's birth record will be updated to reflect their legitimate status. This process affirms the childâ€™s legal status and ensures that they are accorded the full rights of a legitimate child under Philippine law.</p>
