<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> I am currently in the US but need legal advice regarding a wrongful death case involving medical malpractice that occurred several years ago at a hospital in the Philippines. What is the statute of limitations for filing this type of case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong> In the Philippines, wrongful death cases arising from medical malpractice are typically filed as civil actions under the New Civil Code, with a statute of limitations of four years from the time the malpractice occurred or was discovered. If the malpractice led to criminal charges, such as reckless imprudence resulting in death, the period for filing may extend depending on the gravity of the offense. It is crucial to consult with a lawyer immediately to assess the specific details of your case and determine whether the statute of limitations has already lapsed.</p>
