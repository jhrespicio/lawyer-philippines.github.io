<p>An affidavit of admission of paternity is a legal document wherein a father acknowledges his paternity of a child. In the Philippines, notarization of such an affidavit is not just recommended, but often required to give the document legal weight and to ensure its admissibility in court proceedings. Notarization serves to authenticate the identity of the affiant (the person making the affidavit) and confirms that the affidavit was voluntarily executed. Without notarization, the document may not be considered legally binding, which could complicate matters if the paternity is later questioned in legal disputes.</p>
