<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br/>My neighbors are constructing their homes, and itâ€™s getting noisy. Is there a legal timeframe for construction noise, and what time should they stop?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br/>Construction noise is regulated under local ordinances, which vary by city or municipality in the Philippines. Most areas follow a general noise regulation where construction work is permitted during daytime hours, typically between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM on weekdays. Work beyond these hours, particularly at night, requires special permits. It's recommended to check with your local barangay or city hall to determine the specific regulations applicable in your area. If construction noise is becoming a disturbance, you may file a formal complaint with your barangay for mediation or enforcement of local noise regulations.</p>
