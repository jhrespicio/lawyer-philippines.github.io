<p>In the Philippines, employment is primarily governed by the Labor Code, which sets out the just causes for termination of employment. Attempting to sell company property, including scraps, without authorization can be considered serious misconduct or willful disobedience of the lawful orders of the employer. These are valid grounds for termination under Article 297 of the Labor Code. The key factor is the intent and action of the employee in violating company rules or policies, which, if proven, can lead to dismissal. Employees facing such allegations are entitled to due process, which includes the right to be informed of the charges against them and the opportunity to defend themselves in a hearing.</p>
