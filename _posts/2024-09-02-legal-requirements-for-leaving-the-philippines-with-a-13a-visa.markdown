<p>If you hold a 13a visa in the Philippines and plan to leave the country, there are specific legal requirements you must comply with to ensure a smooth departure. The 13a visa, which is a permanent residency visa granted to foreign nationals married to Filipino citizens, allows for multiple entries and exits from the country. However, if you intend to leave the Philippines for an extended period, you must consider the following:</p><p><strong>1. Downgrading Your 13a Visa:</strong> If you plan to stay outside the Philippines for an extended time, you may consider downgrading your 13a visa to a temporary visa. This is especially relevant if your long absence might be interpreted as abandoning your permanent residency status. Downgrading your visa typically involves submitting a formal request to the Bureau of Immigration (BI) and surrendering your Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) I-Card.</p><p><strong>2. Exit Clearance:</strong> Before leaving the country, you may need to secure an Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC) from the BI. The ECC ensures that you have no pending obligations or derogatory records with the Philippine government. The ECC is mandatory for those who have stayed in the Philippines for six months or more on a long-term visa, such as the 13a visa.</p><p><strong>3. Reporting Requirements:</strong> 13a visa holders are required to comply with the annual report requirement, which involves personally appearing at the BI during the first 60 days of each year. If you leave the country and fail to fulfill this requirement, you may face penalties or complications when returning to the Philippines.</p><p><strong>4. Travel Tax Exemption:</strong> As a 13a visa holder, you may be eligible for a travel tax exemption. Ensure that you have the necessary documentation to avail of this benefit when purchasing your plane ticket.</p><p>It is advisable to consult with the Bureau of Immigration or a legal expert before making any decisions regarding your 13a visa status when planning to leave the Philippines.</p>
