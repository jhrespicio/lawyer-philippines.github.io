<p>Training bonds are common in the Philippines, especially in industries where specialized skills are required. A training bond is an agreement between the employer and the employee wherein the employee agrees to work for the employer for a specified period after undergoing company-sponsored training. The bond typically includes a clause that obligates the employee to reimburse the company for the training costs if they leave the company before completing the agreed period.</p><p>However, if the employee is terminated without cause before completing the bond period, the enforceability of the training bond may be questioned. Under Philippine labor law, if an employee is terminated without just cause, the employer may not be able to enforce the training bond or require the employee to pay the remaining amount. Furthermore, withholding salaries or final pay, such as the 10-day work pay mentioned, could be considered unlawful unless the employer has a legal basis to do so, such as a debt or liability of the employee to the employer that has been proven and agreed upon. Employees in such situations should seek legal advice or assistance from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to ensure their rights are protected.</p>
