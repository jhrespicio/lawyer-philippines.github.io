<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><brI fully paid for a piece of land, but the title wasnâ€™t transferred to me. Now, the heirs of the original owner are asking for additional payment to sign the Deed of Sale. What are my legal options?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><brIf you have fully paid for the land but the title was not transferred, the heirs of the original owner have a legal obligation to sign the Deed of Sale and facilitate the transfer of the title to your name. You may remind the heirs that once the full payment has been made, they are contractually bound to complete the sale without demanding additional compensation. If they continue to refuse, you can file a case for specific performance in court to compel them to execute the necessary documents for title transfer. It's advisable to consult a lawyer to review your original contract and assist you in taking legal action if needed.</p>
