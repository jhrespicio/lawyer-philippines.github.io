<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I need to secure a notarized affidavit for my child regarding a particular legal matter. Can you advise me on how I can have this document prepared and notarized? Are there any specific legal requirements that I should be aware of when preparing an affidavit for a minor?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, an affidavit is a written sworn statement used in legal proceedings. To create an affidavit for a child, you must first prepare a document stating the facts relevant to the matter. This may include personal information, declarations regarding guardianship, financial matters, or legal custody, depending on the case. The document should be signed before a notary public to formalize its legal status. Make sure to bring valid identification, and if the affidavit involves legal matters concerning custody or parental rights, it is advisable to consult a lawyer to ensure that all necessary legal points are covered and to avoid any future complications.</p>
