### What can employees do if their agency frequently delays salary payments?

Under Philippine law, it is a fundamental right of employees to receive timely payment of their wages. The Labor Code of the Philippines clearly mandates that wages must be paid at least once every two weeks or twice a month at intervals not exceeding sixteen days. Employers who fail to adhere to this requirement may face legal consequences.

When employees experience repeated delays in receiving their salary, they have several legal options to address this issue:

1. **Filing a Complaint with the DOLE**: Employees can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The DOLE is the primary government agency responsible for enforcing labor laws in the Philippines. Employees can file a complaint at the DOLE regional office where their workplace is located. The DOLE can then summon the employer or the agency to address the issue and may impose penalties if necessary.

2. **Requesting Assistance from a Labor Union**: If the employees are members of a labor union, they can seek assistance from the union to negotiate with the employer. Labor unions have the power to represent employees in disputes regarding wages and other terms of employment.

3. **Filing a Case for Money Claims**: Employees may file a case with the appropriate labor arbiter of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for money claims, including unpaid wages, damages, and attorney's fees. This legal recourse is available if the employer or agency continues to delay salary payments despite repeated requests for compliance.

4. **Seeking Legal Advice**: Employees may also seek legal counsel to explore other legal actions they can take. A lawyer specializing in labor law can provide guidance on the best course of action, whether it involves mediation, arbitration, or litigation.

It is important to document every instance of delayed payment, including communications with the employer or agency regarding the delays. This documentation will be crucial if legal action becomes necessary.

Lastly, while taking legal action is a viable option, employees should also consider the potential implications of such actions on their employment relationship. Legal recourse should be pursued when necessary, but open communication and negotiation with the employer or agency can sometimes lead to a quicker resolution.
