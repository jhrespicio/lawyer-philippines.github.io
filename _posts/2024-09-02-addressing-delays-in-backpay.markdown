<p>Delays in receiving backpay are a common issue faced by employees in the Philippines. The Labor Code of the Philippines mandates that employees who have been separated from their employment, whether through resignation or termination, are entitled to receive their final pay, including backpay, within a reasonable period. If an employer delays or refuses to release the backpay, the affected employee can take several steps to address the issue. Initially, the employee should formally request the release of the backpay through a demand letter. If the employer still fails to comply, the employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). DOLE can mediate between the employer and the employee to resolve the issue. If mediation fails, the employee may elevate the case to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for further action. Legal assistance is recommended to ensure that the employeeâ€™s rights are fully protected throughout this process.</p>
