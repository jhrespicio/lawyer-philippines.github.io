<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I recorded a person without their consent because I wanted to use it as evidence for his unjust grading system. Is recording someone without consent a crime in the Philippines?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, the legality of recording someone without their consent depends on the circumstances. The Anti-Wiretapping Law (Republic Act No. 4200) prohibits the recording of private communication or spoken words without the consent of all parties involved. Violation of this law is a criminal offense. However, if the recording was made in a public setting or during an event where there is no expectation of privacy, it may not be covered by the law. If the intent of the recording is to gather evidence of wrongdoing, you should consult with a lawyer to determine whether this evidence will be admissible in court, as illegally obtained recordings may be excluded from legal proceedings.</p>
