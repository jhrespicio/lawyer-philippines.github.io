<p>The exchange of nude photos or other explicit content among minors is a serious issue with significant legal implications in the Philippines. Under Republic Act No. 9775, also known as the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, the creation, distribution, and possession of child pornography are criminal offenses. Even if both parties involved are minors, the law does not make an exception, and those found guilty can face severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.</p><p>In cases where minors exchange explicit content, both the boy and the girl, along with any adults who may have facilitated or encouraged this behavior, could potentially face legal consequences. The law aims to protect children from exploitation and abuse, recognizing that minors may not fully understand the gravity of their actions. Parents or guardians may also face legal action if they are found to be negligent in supervising their children or if they allowed the exchange of such materials.</p><p>The government, through the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), actively monitors and investigates cases involving child pornography. Schools and communities also play a vital role in educating minors about the dangers and legal ramifications of sharing explicit content. Preventive measures, such as counseling and awareness programs, are essential in addressing this issue and protecting minors from the lifelong consequences of such actions.</p>
