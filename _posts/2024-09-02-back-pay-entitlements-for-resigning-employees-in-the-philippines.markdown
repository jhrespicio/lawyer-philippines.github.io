<p>Back pay, or final pay, is the sum of all compensations owed to an employee upon the end of their employment. For regular employees who resign after working for a significant period, such as three years, their back pay would include their last salary, pro-rated 13th-month pay, unused leave credits, and other applicable benefits. The length of service may influence the amount due in terms of accrued benefits, but it does not inherently result in a ‘large’ back pay unless significant benefits or bonuses have accumulated. The back pay must be computed based on what is legally and contractually owed to the employee and should be processed within a reasonable time after resignation. Employers must ensure that all components of the back pay are correctly calculated and released to avoid disputes.</p>
