<p>In the Philippines, the registered owner of a vehicle can be held legally liable for damages or injuries caused by the vehicle, even if they were not the one driving at the time of the accident. This principle is based on the legal doctrine of vicarious liability, where the owner is responsible for the actions of the person driving the vehicle with their consent. If a registered vehicle is involved in an accident that results in injury or death, the victim or their family may file a civil case for damages against the registered owner. The owner may also face criminal charges depending on the circumstances, especially if it is proven that they were negligent in allowing the driver to operate the vehicle. To mitigate such risks, it is crucial for vehicle owners to exercise due diligence in entrusting their vehicles to responsible and qualified drivers.</p>
