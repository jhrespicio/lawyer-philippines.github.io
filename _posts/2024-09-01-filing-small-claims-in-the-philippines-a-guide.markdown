<p>Small claims court in the Philippines provides a streamlined process for resolving monetary disputes without the need for a lawyer. To file a small claim, you must first ensure that your case falls under the jurisdiction of the small claims court, which typically involves disputes related to money owed, services rendered, or property damage. You begin by filling out the necessary forms, which can be obtained from the Office of the Clerk of Court. Once completed, these forms must be filed at the court where the defendant resides or where the cause of action occurred.
