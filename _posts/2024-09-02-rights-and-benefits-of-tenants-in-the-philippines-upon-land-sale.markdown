<p>The rights and benefits of tenants in the Philippines, particularly those who have been tilling the land for an extended period, are protected under the countryâ€™s agrarian reform laws. When a landowner decides to sell the land, tenants may have certain rights depending on the circumstances.</p><p>Under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), tenants who have been working the land for many years may be entitled to the land or to receive benefits. CARP aims to distribute agricultural land to farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless, giving them the opportunity to own the land they have been cultivating.</p><p>If the land is covered by CARP, the government may acquire the land from the owner and redistribute it to the tenants. These tenants may then become the new owners of the land, paying for it under favorable terms through the Land Bank of the Philippines. Additionally, tenants may be entitled to support services such as access to credit, training, and infrastructure to ensure that they can effectively manage and cultivate the land.</p><p>In cases where the land is not covered by CARP, the rights of tenants may depend on the terms of their lease agreement with the landowner. Even in such cases, the law provides protections to ensure that tenants are not arbitrarily evicted or unfairly treated.</p><p>Tenants who have concerns about their rights upon the sale of the land should consult with legal professionals or the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to fully understand their options and entitlements under Philippine law.</p>
