<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I want to know if there is a case I can file against a person who disgraced me by calling me made-up names, which was meant to degrade my morality. Does the truth of the statement affect the case?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, calling someone derogatory names that can damage their reputation or moral standing may fall under the civil offense of <em>defamation</em>. Defamation is divided into two categories: <em>libel</em> (written or broadcast defamation) and <em>slander</em> (spoken defamation). Even if the statements are not true, if they are intended to harm the personâ€™s reputation, the person making the statements can be held liable for either slander or libel under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. For a defamation case to be successful, it must be proven that the statements were false, malicious, and communicated to others. Additionally, if the statements involve public interest, such as the moral character of a person, this can strengthen the case.</p>
