<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I am currently dealing with issues involving a politician in my barangay who has been causing problems for my family. Is it possible to obtain a restraining order against a politician, and how would I go about it?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, you may apply for a restraining order (Temporary or Permanent Protection Order) if you feel that your safety or that of your family is at risk, even if the person involved is a politician. The first step is to file a formal complaint in court. You may also approach your barangay or seek help from the local police. If the politician is misusing their power, you could also pursue administrative complaints with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
