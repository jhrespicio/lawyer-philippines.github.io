<p>Filing a case with the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) or the Human Settlements Adjudication Commission (HSAC) involves a series of steps that often require legal consultation. Legal consultation typically includes an initial assessment of the case, guidance on the necessary forms and documents, and advice on the filing process. However, it is important to distinguish between the consultation services and the actual legal representation or assistance in filing the case.</p><p>Consultation fees generally cover the cost of the initial legal advice and guidance. If further assistance is needed, such as drafting documents, representing the client in hearings, or submitting the case to the DHSUD/HSAC, additional fees may apply. These fees vary depending on the complexity of the case, the lawyer's expertise, and the extent of the services required.</p><p>Before proceeding, it is advisable to discuss the scope of services and fees with the lawyer during the consultation. This will help avoid any misunderstandings about what is covered under the initial consultation fee and what additional costs may be incurred. Being clear about these aspects can ensure a smooth process in seeking justice through DHSUD/HSAC.</p>
