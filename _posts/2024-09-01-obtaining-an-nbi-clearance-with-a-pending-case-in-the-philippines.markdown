<p>In the Philippines, obtaining an NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) clearance may be complicated if the applicant has a pending criminal case. The NBI clearance process involves a background check, and if there is an ongoing case, it will likely be flagged in the system, resulting in a 'hit.' This does not automatically disqualify the applicant from obtaining the clearance, but it does require further verification. The applicant may need to provide additional documentation or attend a clearance interview to address the issue. The outcome will depend on the nature of the pending case and whether it is resolved before the clearance is issued.</p>
