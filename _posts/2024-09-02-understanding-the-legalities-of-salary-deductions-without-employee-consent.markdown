<p>In the Philippines, salary deductions are regulated by the Labor Code and other relevant laws to protect employees from unauthorized deductions that may reduce their take-home pay. Employers are generally required to obtain the consent of employees before making any deductions from their salaries, except in specific circumstances allowed by law.</p><p>According to Article 113 of the Labor Code, no deductions from the wages of an employee shall be made by an employer for any purpose unless the employee has signed a written agreement authorizing such deductions. Common instances where deductions may be made without prior written consent include deductions for government-mandated contributions such as Social Security System (SSS), Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth contributions, as well as tax withholding as required by law.</p><p>Other deductions, such as those for loans, advances, or damages to company property, generally require the employee’s explicit consent. In cases where an employer deducts from an employee’s salary without proper authorization, the employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). If the deduction is found to be unlawful, the employer may be required to refund the deducted amount and may face penalties.</p><p>Employees should be vigilant about understanding the deductions made from their salaries and ensure that they are lawful and properly documented. Employers, on the other hand, must adhere to legal standards and obtain necessary authorizations before making deductions to avoid legal repercussions.</p>
