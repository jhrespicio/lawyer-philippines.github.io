<p>In the Philippines, threats to post personal images or videos on social media without consent can have serious legal consequences. Such actions can be classified under the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9995) or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). Under these laws, unauthorized recording, reproduction, or distribution of images or videos that compromise an individual's privacy is punishable by law. Victims can file complaints with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group. Penalties may include imprisonment and substantial fines. The laws aim to protect individuals from online harassment, cyberbullying, and violations of privacy. Individuals should seek legal advice and report such threats to authorities to ensure their rights are protected.</p>
