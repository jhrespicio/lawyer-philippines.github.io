<p>In the Philippines, any construction, renovation, or alteration work typically requires a building permit. This includes the replacement of a roof, even if it seems like a minor renovation.</p><p>The National Building Code of the Philippines mandates that a building permit must be secured before commencing any work that involves changes to the structure of a building, which includes roof replacement. This is to ensure that the construction work complies with safety standards and local regulations.</p><p>Even if the roof replacement is considered minor, such as simply changing the roofing material, it is still advisable to consult with the local municipal office to confirm whether a permit is necessary. In many cases, a renovation permit might be required instead of a full building permit, depending on the extent of the work.</p><p>Failure to secure the necessary permits can lead to penalties, fines, or even a stop-work order. To avoid any legal issues, it is always best to follow the proper procedures and obtain the required permits before starting any renovation or construction work.</p>
