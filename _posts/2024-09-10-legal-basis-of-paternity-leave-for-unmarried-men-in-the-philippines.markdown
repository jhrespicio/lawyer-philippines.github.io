<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to inquire about the legal basis for paternity leave in the Philippines. I am not married but recently had a child. Am I still entitled to paternity leave?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the legal basis for paternity leave is Republic Act No. 8187, also known as the Paternity Leave Act of 1996. This law grants paternity leave to all married male employees in the private and public sectors. Unfortunately, under current regulations, only legally married fathers are entitled to paternity leave. Unmarried fathers are not covered by this provision, which means that, as of now, you would not be eligible for paternity leave unless you are legally married to the mother of your child. However, some companies offer more generous benefits than what is legally mandated, so it may be worth inquiring with your employer about their specific policies.</p>
