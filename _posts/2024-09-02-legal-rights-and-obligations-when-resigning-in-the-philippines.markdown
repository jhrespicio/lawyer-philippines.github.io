<p>Resignation is the voluntary act of an employee to terminate their employment relationship with their employer. In the Philippines, the Labor Code governs the procedures and obligations surrounding resignation. According to Article 285 of the Labor Code, an employee may terminate their employment without just cause by serving a written notice to their employer at least one month in advance. This 30-day notice period is mandatory unless the employer waives it or the employee has a valid reason for immediate resignation, such as health concerns or harassment.</p><p>If an employee resigns without serving the 30-day notice and without a valid reason, the employer may have grounds to withhold the employee’s final pay or take other actions as provided by company policy. However, employers are encouraged to handle such situations with flexibility and compassion, particularly when the employee’s reasons for resignation are rooted in legitimate concerns about their work environment or well-being.</p><p>It is essential for employees to understand their rights and obligations when resigning and for employers to respect those rights while also considering the needs of the business. Both parties should aim for a smooth transition that minimizes disruptions and maintains professional relationships.</p>
