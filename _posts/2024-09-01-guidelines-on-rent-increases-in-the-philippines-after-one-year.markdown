<p>In the Philippines, rent increases are generally allowed once the lease contract has reached its term, often after one year. However, the amount of the increase and the conditions under which it can be implemented are subject to the Rent Control Act (Republic Act No. 9653). The law caps the allowable rent increase depending on the amount of rent and the location of the property. Landlords must provide tenants with at least a 30-day notice before the increase takes effect, and any increase that exceeds the allowed limit may be contested by the tenant. Itâ€™s important for both landlords and tenants to be aware of their rights and obligations under the lease agreement and relevant laws to avoid disputes.</p>
