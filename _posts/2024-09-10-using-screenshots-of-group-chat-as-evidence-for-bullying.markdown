<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to file a complaint about bullying in our group chat. Is it permissible to attach screenshots of the group conversation where I was bullied as evidence in my complaint letter?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Screenshots of group chat conversations can indeed be used as evidence when filing a complaint for bullying or harassment. The Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 and other related laws in the Philippines allow for the presentation of electronic evidence such as screenshots or chat records, as long as the authenticity of the messages can be proven. You should ensure that the messages reflect the context of the situation accurately and that they have not been altered. Submit them along with your formal complaint, and ensure that your narrative aligns with the content of the screenshots to provide a coherent and compelling case.</p>
