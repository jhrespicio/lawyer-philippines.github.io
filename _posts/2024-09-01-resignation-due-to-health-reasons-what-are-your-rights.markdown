<p>If you are experiencing health issues, such as depression and panic attacks, that make it difficult for you to continue working, you have the right to resign from your job. In the Philippines, labor laws allow employees to resign immediately for just causes, which include serious health conditions.</p><p>However, it is advisable to provide your employer with a medical certificate from a licensed physician to support your claim of health-related reasons for resignation. This documentation can help protect you from potential disputes or claims from your employer regarding the immediate nature of your resignation.</p><p>If you are unable to serve the usual 30-day notice period due to your health condition, your employer cannot legally penalize you.
