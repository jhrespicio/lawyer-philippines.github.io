### What can you do if an online loan app harasses you in the Philippines?

Harassment by online loan apps has become a growing concern in the Philippines. Many borrowers have reported receiving abusive calls, messages, and threats from loan app representatives. Some even experience harassment on social media platforms, where their personal information is exposed to friends and family, causing significant distress and reputational damage. 

#### Legal Protections Under Philippine Law

The Philippines has specific laws and regulations to protect consumers from such predatory practices. The most relevant of these include the following:

1. **Republic Act No. 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012):** This law ensures the protection of personal data in the information age. It requires that companies, including online loan apps, handle personal information with a high degree of confidentiality. If an online loan app uses or discloses your personal information without your consent, or worse, if it threatens to do so as a means to collect debt, it may be in violation of this law.

2. **Republic Act No. 8484 (Access Devices Regulation Act of 1998):** This law penalizes the fraudulent use of access devices like credit cards and debit cards. More importantly, it also covers the harassment of cardholders. Although primarily focused on credit devices, its principles extend to the harassment related to online loans, particularly if it involves threats, intimidation, or public shaming.

3. **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (BP 22 - The Bouncing Checks Law):** If post-dated checks were issued as payment for loans and they bounced, harassment related to this could be subject to penalties under BP 22. However, mere harassment without the issuance of a bad check falls under other legal categories.

4. **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Under the Civil Code, acts of harassment may constitute a violation of the borrower's civil rights. This could lead to civil liability on the part of the lender, particularly for moral damages due to the distress caused by their actions.

5. **Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175):** Cyberbullying and online harassment are punishable under this act. If an online loan app engages in cyberbullying tactics, such as sending threatening messages or publicly shaming a borrower online, they may be liable under this law.

#### Remedies for Victims

If you are a victim of harassment by an online loan app, here are steps you can take:

1. **Document Everything:** Keep records of all communications, including texts, emails, and call logs. Screenshots of social media posts and messages are also crucial.

2. **File a Complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC):** If your personal data has been mishandled or misused, you can file a complaint with the NPC, which is tasked with enforcing the Data Privacy Act.

3. **Report to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP):** The BSP oversees financial institutions, including some online lending companies. You can file a complaint if the lending app is under BSP's regulation.

4. **Seek Legal Advice:** Consider consulting with a lawyer to explore filing a civil case for damages or a criminal case under the relevant laws.

5. **Report to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP):** For cases involving severe harassment or cybercrime, reporting to the NBI Cybercrime Division or the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group can lead to a criminal investigation.

#### Conclusion

Borrowers are not without recourse when faced with harassment from online loan apps. Philippine laws provide several avenues for redress, and taking the right steps can help protect your rights and dignity. If you find yourself in such a situation, it's important to act quickly and consult with legal professionals to ensure that your case is handled effectively.
