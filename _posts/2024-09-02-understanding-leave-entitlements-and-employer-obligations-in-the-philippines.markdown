<p>In the Philippines, employees are entitled to various types of leave, such as vacation leave, sick leave, and special leave for specific circumstances. The granting of leave is subject to the approval of the employer, but there are legal protections in place to ensure that employees are not unfairly denied their entitlements, particularly when rendering their 30-day resignation notice.</p><p>According to the Labor Code of the Philippines, employees who have rendered at least one year of service are entitled to service incentive leave of at least five days with pay each year. While the law does not mandate specific vacation or sick leaves, many companies provide these as part of their employment contracts or through collective bargaining agreements.</p><p>During the 30-day notice period, an employee may request to use their accrued leave credits. Employers are generally expected to grant these requests, especially if the leave is justified, such as for medical reasons or to prepare for the transition to a new job. However, the employer also has the right to deny leave requests if they can demonstrate that the employee’s absence would unduly disrupt business operations.</p><p>If an employer unjustly refuses to grant leave during the resignation period, the employee may have grounds to file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The DOLE can mediate the dispute or take further action to ensure that the employee’s rights are respected.</p><p>It is important for both employers and employees to understand their respective rights and obligations regarding leave entitlements. Clear communication and mutual respect during the resignation process can prevent conflicts and ensure a smooth transition for both parties.</p>
