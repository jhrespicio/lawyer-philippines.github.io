<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I would like to know the difference between residential and commercial property classification, especially if the document shows the type as "Commercial." What factors determine whether a property is classified as residential or commercial?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>The classification of a property as "Residential" or "Commercial" primarily depends on its intended use, as specified in local zoning ordinances and regulations. Residential properties are typically used for housing, such as single-family homes, apartments, or condominiums, while commercial properties are used for business operations like offices, retail spaces, or industrial activities.</p><p>Commercial properties often have higher property taxes and stricter regulations, especially when it comes to construction and usage. To determine the classification of your property, you can check the local zoning ordinance where your property is located. Additionally, if you wish to change the classification of your property, such as from residential to commercial, you may need to apply for a zoning reclassification with your local government unit.</p>
