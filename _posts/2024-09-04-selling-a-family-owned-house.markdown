<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My father wants to sell the house where we are currently living. I would like to know if he can do so without my consent as one of the occupants.</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, if the property in question is solely owned by your father, he has the right to sell it without the consent of other occupants, provided that no legal agreement or encumbrance exists preventing him from doing so. However, if the property is co-owned, or if it was inherited by multiple heirs, all co-owners or heirs must consent to the sale. If the house forms part of a conjugal property, and your mother is still alive, her consent may also be required. It is advisable to check the property's title and any existing legal agreements to ensure all parties' rights are respected.</p>
