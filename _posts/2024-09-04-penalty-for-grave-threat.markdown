<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br> What is the penalty for grave threat under Philippine law?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br> Grave threat, as defined under Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code, involves threatening another person with a wrong that may constitute a crime, such as harm to their life or property. The penalty for grave threats depends on the nature of the threat. If the threat is made with the intent to demand money or other materials, the penalty ranges from prision mayor (6 years and 1 day to 12 years) to prision correccional (6 months and 1 day to 6 years), depending on the circumstances. If the threat does not involve such demands, the penalty may range from arresto mayor (1 month and 1 day to 6 months) to a fine. It is important to note that each case is evaluated based on its specific facts.</p>
