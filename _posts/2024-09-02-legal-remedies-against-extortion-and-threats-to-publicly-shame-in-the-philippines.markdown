<p>In the Philippines, any act of extortion or threats of public shaming, especially in the context of debt collection, is illegal and punishable under various laws. Extortion is covered by the Revised Penal Code under Article 294, which penalizes robbery with intimidation or violence. The act of threatening to expose or publicize someone's non-payment of debt on social media constitutes an unlawful coercion, which is punishable under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code. This provision penalizes any person who, by means of threats, compels another to perform an act that is not their duty to do or prevents them from doing something that is lawful.</p><p>Moreover, the Anti-Cybercrime Law (Republic Act No. 10175) also covers such acts if the threat or shaming is conducted through digital platforms. Under this law, cyber libel and online threats are punishable offenses. The victim of such acts can file a criminal complaint before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Cybercrime Group. Additionally, the victim may seek a restraining order or injunction from the court to prevent further harassment.</p><p>It is essential to document all communications and gather evidence, such as screenshots or recordings of the threats, to support any legal action. The victim may also file for civil damages under the Civil Code of the Philippines for any emotional or psychological distress caused by the extortion and threats.</p>
