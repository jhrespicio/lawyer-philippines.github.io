<p>Termination of parental rights is a serious legal action that involves permanently severing the legal relationship between a parent and their child. In the Philippines, the Family Code and other relevant laws provide the grounds and procedures for terminating parental rights.</p><p>Parental rights may be terminated for various reasons, including but not limited to abandonment, neglect, abuse, or when a parent is found to be unfit to care for the child. The termination process usually requires a court proceeding where evidence is presented to support the claim that the parent should no longer have rights over the child.</p><p>Once parental rights are terminated, the parent loses all legal rights and obligations towards the child, including custody, decision-making, and inheritance rights. The child may then be eligible for adoption, where a new legal parent-child relationship is established. Due to the gravity of terminating parental rights, courts in the Philippines carefully consider all circumstances to ensure that the best interests of the child are upheld.</p>
