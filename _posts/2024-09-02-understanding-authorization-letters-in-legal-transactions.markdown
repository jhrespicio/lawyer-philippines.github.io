<p>Authorization letters are essential documents used in legal transactions to grant permission or authority to another person to act on behalf of the author. This document is commonly used in various situations, such as authorizing someone to pick up documents, process papers, or represent the author in legal matters. The letter must clearly state the scope of authority, including specific actions the authorized person is allowed to perform. It should also include details such as the date, the names of both the author and the authorized person, and the purpose of the authorization. In the Philippines, an authorization letter is generally recognized as valid if it is signed by the author, contains a clear statement of intent, and is presented with proper identification. However, in some cases, it may require notarization to ensure its legality, particularly when it involves significant legal matters.</p>
