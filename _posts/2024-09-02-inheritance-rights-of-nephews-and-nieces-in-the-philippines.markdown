<p>In the Philippines, inheritance is governed by the Civil Code, specifically under the laws of succession. When a person dies intestate, meaning without leaving a will, the distribution of their estate follows a specific order of succession. The law prioritizes the compulsory heirs, such as the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate children, and legitimate parents.</p><p>In the case where a deceased person has no spouse, children, or parents, the inheritance may pass to the collateral relatives, such as siblings, nephews, and nieces. If a brother dies and leaves no spouse or children, his siblings are the next in line to inherit his estate. However, if a sibling predeceased the decedent and left children (i.e., nephews and nieces of the decedent), these nephews and nieces may inherit in place of their deceased parent through the right of representation.</p><p>The right of representation allows the children of a deceased heir to inherit the share that their parent would have received if they were alive. This means that the nephews and nieces of the deceased person who just died would have the right to inherit, provided their parent (the deceasedâ€™s sibling) predeceased the decedent.</p><p>It is important to consult with a legal expert in inheritance law to ensure that the proper procedures are followed and that the rights of all potential heirs are respected. Legal advice is particularly crucial in cases where there might be disputes over the distribution of the estate or when the succession involves multiple heirs.</p>
