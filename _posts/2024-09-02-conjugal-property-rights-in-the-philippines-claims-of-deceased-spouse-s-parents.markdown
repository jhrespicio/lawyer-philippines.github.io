<p>Under Philippine law, specifically the Family Code, conjugal property refers to property acquired by either spouse during the marriage. Upon the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse retains ownership of their share of the conjugal property, while the deceased spouse's share is distributed according to the rules of succession.</p><p>If the deceased spouse has no children, the distribution of their share of the conjugal property follows the order of succession outlined in the Civil Code. The parents of the deceased spouse are among the legal heirs who are entitled to a portion of the deceased’s share of the conjugal property, provided there are no direct descendants (such as children or grandchildren). The surviving spouse is also entitled to a portion of the deceased’s estate, along with the parents.</p><p>The exact distribution of the property depends on whether the deceased left a will (testate succession) or died without one (intestate succession). In intestate succession, if both parents of the deceased are still alive, they share the portion of the estate allocated to them by law. If only one parent survives, that parent takes the entire share allotted to the parents.</p><p>To properly determine the distribution of the deceased’s share in the conjugal property, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in family law. This will ensure that the process complies with legal requirements and that the rights of all parties involved are protected.</p>
