<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My previous employer has been ignoring my requests for a Certificate of Employment (COE) after I resigned. I need the COE for my next job application. What legal steps can I take to obtain my COE?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, employees have a right to request a Certificate of Employment (COE) from their previous employer upon the termination of employment, whether due to resignation or dismissal. The employer is obligated to provide the COE under the Labor Code of the Philippines. Failure to do so may be considered an unlawful act, and the employee can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for non-issuance of the COE. The COE should only state the duration of employment and the nature of the work performed. It is recommended to formally request the COE through a written letter before pursuing legal action.</p>
