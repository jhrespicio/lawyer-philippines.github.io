<p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance is a standard requirement for various purposes in the Philippines, such as employment, travel, or business transactions. One common concern is whether a derogatory record, particularly if someone has been convicted of a crime, will appear on their NBI clearance. A derogatory record refers to any negative information that may be associated with a person's name, such as criminal convictions, pending cases, or outstanding warrants. If a person has been convicted, this information is likely to appear in their NBI clearance. However, the presence of a derogatory record does not automatically disqualify a person from employment or other opportunities; it depends on the nature of the offense and the requirements of the specific situation. It is advisable to address any derogatory records before applying for an NBI clearance, such as settling pending cases or securing necessary documentation to explain the situation.</p>
