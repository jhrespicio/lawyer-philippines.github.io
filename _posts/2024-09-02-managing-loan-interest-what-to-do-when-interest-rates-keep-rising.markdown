<p>When taking out a loan, it is vital to understand how interest rates work and the impact they can have on your overall debt. In the Philippines, interest rates on loans can vary depending on the type of loan and the lender's policies. If you find yourself struggling with rising interest rates, it is important to take proactive steps to manage your debt. Start by reviewing the terms of your loan agreement to understand how the interest is calculated. If possible, consider refinancing your loan to secure a lower interest rate. Additionally, creating a budget that prioritizes debt repayment can help you reduce the principal amount, which in turn lowers the interest you will need to pay over time. Seek advice from financial experts or credit counselors who can guide you through your options. Remember, ignoring rising interest rates can lead to a cycle of increasing debt, so it is crucial to address the issue as soon as possible.</p>
