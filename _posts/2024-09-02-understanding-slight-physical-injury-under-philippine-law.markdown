<p>Slight physical injury is classified as a crime under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. It involves physical harm that does not result in incapacitation for more than nine days or require medical attention for an extended period. Examples include bruises, scratches, or any injury that causes temporary pain or discomfort. The penalty for slight physical injury is typically a fine or imprisonment for up to 30 days, depending on the circumstances and severity of the injury. In some cases, the court may also consider the relationship between the parties, intent, and any aggravating circumstances. Victims of slight physical injury can file a complaint directly with the police or prosecutorâ€™s office, bypassing the barangay mediation process if the offense falls under specific exceptions.</p>
