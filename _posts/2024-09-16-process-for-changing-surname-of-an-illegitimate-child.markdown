<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>What is the legal process to change the surname of an illegitimate child in the Philippines?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, an illegitimate child is usually required to use the surname of the mother, unless the biological father formally acknowledges the child. To change the surname of an illegitimate child to that of the father, several steps must be followed. If the father has acknowledged the child at birth or through an Affidavit of Acknowledgment or Admission of Paternity, the child may carry the father’s surname. However, if the acknowledgment comes after birth registration, you will need to file a petition with the local civil registrar to change the surname. Should the father not acknowledge the child, the child must continue using the mother’s surname unless further legal actions are taken, such as legitimation through the subsequent marriage of the parents.</p>
