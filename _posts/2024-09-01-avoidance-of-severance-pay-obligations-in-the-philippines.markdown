<p>In the context of Philippine labor law, employers are generally required to provide severance pay or separation benefits to employees who are terminated under certain conditions. However, there have been instances where companies may attempt to circumvent this obligation. Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, termination must be for a just or authorized cause, and the employee is entitled to due process. If an employer intentionally manipulates the situation to avoid paying severance—such as by coercing employees into resignation or engaging in constructive dismissal—this could be considered unlawful. Employees who believe they have been unfairly deprived of their separation benefits can file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) or pursue legal action through the appropriate labor courts.</p>
