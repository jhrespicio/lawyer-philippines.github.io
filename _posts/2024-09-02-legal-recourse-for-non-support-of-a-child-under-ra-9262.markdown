<p>Republic Act No. 9262, also known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004, provides protection to women and children against various forms of abuse, including economic abuse. Economic abuse refers to acts that make a woman financially dependent, such as withholding financial support. If a father fails to provide financial support for his child despite an existing agreement, the mother can file a case under RA 9262. This law mandates that fathers must provide financial support as part of their parental obligations. The mother can approach the barangay for mediation, but if the issue is not resolved, she can escalate the matter to the courts. The court may issue a Protection Order, which includes provisions for financial support. Failure to comply with a court-issued Protection Order can result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment.</p>
