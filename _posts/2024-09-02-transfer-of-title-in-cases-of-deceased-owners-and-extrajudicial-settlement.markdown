<p>When a property in the Philippines is registered in the names of multiple individuals, and some of those individuals pass away, transferring the title to the surviving heirs can be a complex process. This situation often arises when a title is under the names of parents and other relatives, some of whom are deceased.</p><p>The transfer of property title from deceased owners to the heirs generally requires the execution of an extrajudicial settlement, especially when the deceased did not leave a will. An extrajudicial settlement is a legal document where the heirs agree on how the estate will be divided among them. In cases where all the heirs are in agreement, the process can be straightforward.</p><p>However, complications can arise when some heirs are abroad or unavailable to sign the extrajudicial settlement. While a surviving spouse may have certain automatic rights to inherit the property, the participation of all legal heirs is generally required to execute the transfer of title. This means that the children or other heirs, even if they are abroad, typically need to sign the document or provide a special power of attorney authorizing someone to sign on their behalf.</p><p>It is essential to ensure that the extrajudicial settlement is properly drafted and signed by all concerned parties to avoid legal disputes. The document must be notarized and published in a newspaper of general circulation to notify other potential heirs or claimants. After completing these steps, the settlement can be presented to the Registry of Deeds for the transfer of the title to the new owners.</p><p>Legal advice is highly recommended in these situations to ensure compliance with all legal requirements and to facilitate a smooth transfer of the property title.</p>
