<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>My partner is still married to her ex-husband, but they have been separated for eight years. They both signed a letter stating their separation. Can she remarry here in New Zealand?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, marriage is legally binding until it is annulled or declared void by a court. Separation, whether physical or through a mutual agreement, does not dissolve the marriage. Therefore, your partner cannot legally remarry in the Philippines or in any other jurisdiction, including New Zealand, unless she obtains an annulment or a declaration of nullity of marriage from a Philippine court. Proceeding with another marriage without annulling the first would constitute bigamy, which is a criminal offense in the Philippines.</p>
