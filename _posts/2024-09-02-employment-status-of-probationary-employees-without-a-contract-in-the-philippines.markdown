<p>In the Philippines, the employment status of probationary employees without a written contract is a significant concern, both for employers and employees. The Labor Code of the Philippines, particularly Article 281, governs the conditions of probationary employment. Generally, a probationary employee is one who is on trial by an employer to determine their suitability for regular employment. The probationary period should not exceed six months from the date the employee started working unless an apprenticeship agreement provides a longer period.</p><p>Even without a written contract, probationary employees are entitled to the same rights and benefits as regular employees during their probationary period. These include the right to receive a just wage, to be treated fairly, and to be informed of the standards that will make them regular employees. If these standards are not communicated or if the probationary period exceeds six months without a justified extension, the employee is deemed a regular employee under the law.</p><p>Furthermore, the absence of a written contract does not diminish the employer's obligation to comply with the requirements for terminating a probationary employee. Termination must be based on either a just cause (e.g., serious misconduct, gross and habitual neglect of duties) or the employee's failure to meet the reasonable standards made known by the employer at the time of engagement. Failure to adhere to these legal provisions could render the termination illegal, thereby entitling the employee to reinstatement and full back wages.</p><p>Employers are advised to always formalize employment relationships with clear, written contracts that outline the terms of the probationary period, including job expectations, performance standards, and the consequences of failing to meet these standards. This helps prevent disputes and ensures compliance with labor laws.</p>
