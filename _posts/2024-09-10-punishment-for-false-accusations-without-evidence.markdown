<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>What happens if someone accuses me of a crime without any evidence to support their claim? What legal recourse do I have in the Philippines for false accusations?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, if someone accuses you of a crime without sufficient evidence, they may be liable for libel or slander, depending on the context of the false accusation. If the accusation is made in writing or through public statements, it may constitute libel under the Revised Penal Code. If made verbally, it could fall under slander. Both offenses are punishable by imprisonment and fines. Additionally, the accused may file a civil case for damages caused by the false accusation, such as harm to reputation or emotional distress. However, the specific punishment depends on the evidence presented and the courtâ€™s ruling on the matter.</p>
