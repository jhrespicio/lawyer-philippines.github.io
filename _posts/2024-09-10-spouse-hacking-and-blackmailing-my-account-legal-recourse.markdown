<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>My spouse hacked into my personal account and is now blackmailing me with information they found there. What legal steps can I take to address this?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>Hacking into another personâ€™s account, even by a spouse, constitutes a violation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) in the Philippines. Unauthorized access to a computer system or account is considered illegal under the provisions of this law. Furthermore, blackmail or extortion using private information could lead to charges of grave coercion or unjust vexation under the Revised Penal Code. You can file a complaint with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) Cybercrime Unit. It is crucial to collect evidence, such as screenshots and messages, to support your claims.</p>
