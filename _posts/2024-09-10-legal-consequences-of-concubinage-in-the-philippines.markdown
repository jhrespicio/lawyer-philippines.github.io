<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I would like to ask about the penalties associated with the crime of concubinage. How severe is the punishment for a person found guilty of this crime?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, concubinage is a crime under the Revised Penal Code. It occurs when a husband, under specific circumstances, cohabits with a woman who is not his wife or engages in illicit sexual relations in the conjugal dwelling. The punishment for concubinage is imprisonment, typically ranging from 6 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months (prisión correccional in its minimum and medium periods). Additionally, the concubine may face a lighter penalty of destierro, which means they are ordered to live at least 25 kilometers away from the complainant. It’s essential to note that concubinage is a criminal offense that can only be initiated through a formal complaint filed by the wife.</p>
