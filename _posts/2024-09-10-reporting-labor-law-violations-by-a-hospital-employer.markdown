<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong></p><p>I used to work in a hospital where we were required to work 24-hour shifts, five days a week. I believe this may be a violation of labor laws. Where can I report this kind of labor law violation?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong></p><p>Under Philippine labor laws, the maximum allowable working hours are typically 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week. Requiring employees to work beyond this without proper compensation, overtime pay, or required rest periods can constitute a violation of labor standards. You can report such violations to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Specifically, DOLE's Bureau of Working Conditions (BWC) handles cases related to excessive work hours, non-payment of overtime, and other related issues. You may file a formal complaint at the nearest DOLE regional or field office. DOLE also provides hotlines and online platforms for reporting labor law violations.</p>
