<p>The Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) was implemented to provide Filipinos with a single, unified national ID. However, delays in the issuance of the physical ID card have been a common issue. In such cases, the stub or transaction slip provided at the time of registration serves as proof that an individual has applied for their national ID. This stub can be crucial, especially when required for government programs like the 4Ps (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program).</p><p>If a person has lost their stub or needs a reprint, the first step is to contact the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) or the registration center where the application was initially processed. Some centers may have the capability to reprint the stub or issue a certification that serves the same purpose.</p><p>It is important to note that the stub is not a substitute for the actual ID, but it can temporarily fulfill identification requirements in some instances. For those facing significant delays in receiving their ID, it may be helpful to follow up regularly with the PSA through their official channels.</p><p>In some cases, presenting the stub along with another valid form of identification may be necessary when accessing services or fulfilling requirements. Individuals are encouraged to keep a copy of their original stub or to secure a reprint promptly to avoid inconveniences.</p>
