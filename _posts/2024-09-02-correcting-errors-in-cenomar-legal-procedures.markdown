<p>The Certificate of No Marriage (CENOMAR) is a crucial document in the Philippines, often required for marriage and other legal purposes. Occasionally, errors may occur in the issuance of a CENOMAR, such as the incorrect recording of multiple marriages. If a person discovers an error in their CENOMAR, legal procedures are available to correct it.</p><p>First, the concerned individual must obtain a certification from the Local Civil Registrar (LCR) or the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) indicating that there was an error in the record. If the error pertains to a marriage that was recorded but never legally occurred, the individual must secure a court order declaring that the marriage was void or non-existent.</p><p>To initiate this process, the individual must file a petition for correction of entry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. The petition should include all relevant documents, such as the erroneous CENOMAR, the marriage certificate (if any), and other supporting evidence that can prove the inaccuracy of the records.</p><p>Once the petition is filed, the court will schedule a hearing, during which the petitioner must present their case. If the court finds merit in the petition, it will issue an order directing the PSA to amend the CENOMAR and reflect the correct information.</p><p>This corrected CENOMAR will then serve as the official document for all legal purposes, confirming the individualâ€™s marital status as accurately recorded.</p>
