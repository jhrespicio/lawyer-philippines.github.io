<p>In the Philippines, the process of changing the surname of an illegitimate child involves specific legal steps, particularly if the child’s surname was originally registered under the mother’s name. According to Republic Act No. 9255, an illegitimate child shall generally use the surname of the mother. However, if the father acknowledges paternity, the child may use the father’s surname.</p><p>If the mother later marries a man who wishes to adopt the child, the child’s surname may be changed to that of the adoptive father through legal adoption. The legal adoption process is governed by the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998, or Republic Act No. 8552. This process requires the filing of a petition for adoption with the Family Court, which will evaluate the suitability of the adoptive parents and the best interests of the child.</p><p>Once the court grants the adoption, the child’s new surname will be reflected in the amended birth certificate. It is crucial to note that the change of surname through adoption is not automatic and requires the court's approval. Additionally, the child must consent to the adoption if they are over ten years old.</p><p>For cases where the father acknowledges the child after birth and the mother consents, the child’s surname may be changed to the father’s surname without the need for adoption. This process involves the execution of an affidavit of acknowledgment and the filing of a petition with the local civil registry.</p>
