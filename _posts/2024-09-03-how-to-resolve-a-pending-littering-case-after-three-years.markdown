<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I have a pending case with the government for littering. The incident happened three years ago, and I’m concerned about how I can resolve this matter. What steps should I take?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>In the Philippines, the law regarding littering is typically governed by local ordinances, which vary depending on the city or municipality. Although three years have passed, you should still address this issue promptly. First, visit the local government office or the court where the case was filed to check the status of your case. There might be fines or penalties that need to be settled. If the case has not been resolved, it’s advisable to pay the fine to avoid further legal complications. You may also inquire about the possibility of a plea bargain or settlement to minimize the consequences. Legal representation might be necessary if the case has escalated to a higher court.</p>
