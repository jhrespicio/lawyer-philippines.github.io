<p>In the Philippines, the Liga ng mga Barangay (Association of Barangays) plays a significant role in representing the interests of barangay residents. While barangay councils typically handle local disputes through conciliation under the Katarungang Pambarangay Law (Presidential Decree No. 1508), they may also file civil cases on behalf of their constituents when there is a collective concern that affects the community. For instance, if a water district fails to provide adequate services, the Liga ng mga Barangay may file a civil case to protect the rights and welfare of the barangay residents. Such actions are usually supported by the barangay resolution, reflecting the collective decision of the council members.</p>
