<h2>Marriage Annulment in the Philippines</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, marriage is considered a sacred and legally binding institution.  However, certain circumstances may render a marriage voidable or annulled. This article provides an overview of the legal grounds and procedures for marriage annulment in the country.</p>
<h3>Difference Between Annulment and Legal Separation</h3>
<p>It's important to distinguish annulment from legal separation.  Annulment declares a marriage void from the beginning, as if it never happened, due to grounds present at the time of marriage. Legal separation, on the other hand, allows couples to live apart and separates their properties but doesn't dissolve the marriage bond.</p>
<h3>Grounds for Annulment</h3>
<p>The Family Code of the Philippines outlines specific grounds for annulment, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Parental Consent:</strong>  If one or both parties were below 21 years old and married without parental consent.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud:</strong>  If one spouse was induced into marriage through deceit regarding identity, citizenship, or other essential matters.</li>
<li><strong>Force, Intimidation, or Undue Influence:</strong> If one party was coerced into marriage against their will.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Incapacity to Consummate the Marriage:</strong>  If one spouse is physically incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse, rendering the marriage unconsummated.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Incapacity:</strong>  If one or both spouses suffer from a psychological disorder that prevents them from fulfilling their marital obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Annulment Process</h3>
<p>Annulment proceedings generally involve the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filing a Petition:</strong>  The aggrieved spouse, through a lawyer, files a petition for annulment with the Regional Trial Court.</li>
<li><strong>Court Proceedings:</strong>  The court hears evidence, including testimonies from the parties, witnesses, and experts.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong>  If the court finds sufficient grounds, it will issue a decree of annulment.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Effects of Annulment</h3>
<p>An annulment decree declares the marriage void from the beginning.  Some legal consequences include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marital Status:</strong>  Both parties are considered single again.</li>
<li><strong>Property Relations:</strong>  Properties acquired during the marriage are generally divided according to existing laws.</li>
<li><strong>Children:</strong>  Children born during the marriage are considered legitimate.  Custody, support, and visitation rights are determined by the court.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Marriage annulment is a complex legal process in the Philippines, governed by specific grounds and procedures.  Seeking legal advice from a qualified family law attorney is crucial for anyone considering this option.</p>
