<p>A separation agreement is a contract between an employer and an employee who is leaving the company, outlining the terms of their separation. In the Philippines, signing a separation agreement is often a prerequisite for receiving final pay and other benefits. The agreement may include clauses stating that the employee has received all due payments, including separation pay, and that they waive any further claims against the employer. However, employees should carefully review the agreement before signing, as it is a legally binding document. If the employee has not yet received their final pay or if there are discrepancies in the agreement, they should raise these issues with the employer before signing. Refusing to sign the agreement may lead to further investigation by the company, as indicated by the terms outlined by the employer. Employees are encouraged to seek legal advice to ensure that their rights are protected and that they fully understand the implications of signing or refusing to sign a separation agreement.</p>
