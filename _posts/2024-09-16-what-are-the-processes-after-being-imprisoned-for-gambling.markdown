<p><strong>Dear Attorney,</strong><br>I was recently arrested for illegal gambling, and I would like to know the legal processes involved after being imprisoned for this offense. What should I expect in terms of legal proceedings and penalties?</p><p><strong>Insights:</strong><br>If you are caught gambling illegally, the first step is your arrest and detention, which typically leads to the filing of a criminal complaint against you. You will undergo inquest proceedings to determine if there is sufficient basis for your arrest. If the inquest prosecutor finds probable cause, you may face formal charges under Presidential Decree No. 1602, which penalizes illegal gambling. You may be allowed to post bail, depending on the severity of the charge. Afterward, your case will proceed to trial, where you can present your defense. If found guilty, penalties may range from fines to imprisonment, depending on the offense and its aggravating factors.</p>
