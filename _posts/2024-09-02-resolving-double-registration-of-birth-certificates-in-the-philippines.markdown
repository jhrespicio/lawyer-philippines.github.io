This issue can lead to complications, especially when the individual needs to secure important documents such as passports, school records, or government IDs. In the Philippines, addressing double registration requires a legal process to determine the correct and valid record.</p><p>The affected individual or their parents/guardians must file a petition for cancellation or correction of the erroneous entry before the Local Civil Registry Office (LCRO) where the birth was registered. The petition should include supporting documents, such as copies of both birth certificates and any relevant identification or school records, to establish which record is correct.</p><p>In cases where the discrepancy involves the childâ€™s surname or other significant details, a court order may be necessary to resolve the issue. The petition for cancellation or correction should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and the process may include a hearing and publication requirements.</p><p>Once the court or the LCRO has made a decision, the appropriate record will be retained, and the other will be canceled or corrected. The corrected birth certificate will then be the basis for all future transactions, and a copy can be requested from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).</p><p>It is advisable to seek legal assistance when dealing with double registration to ensure that the correct legal procedures are followed and to avoid further complications.</p>
