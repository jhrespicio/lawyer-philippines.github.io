These benefits typically include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Final Pay:</strong> This consists of your last salary, including any earned but unused leave credits, 13th-month pay proportionate to the months worked during the year, and any other benefits stipulated in your employment contract.</li><li><strong>Separation Pay:</strong> This is not typically granted in voluntary resignation cases unless stated in your contract or company policy.
