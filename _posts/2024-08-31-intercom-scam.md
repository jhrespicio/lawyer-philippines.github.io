### Question: Is an online shopping platform liable if customer information is used without authorization in a scam?

In the Philippines, the liability of online shopping platforms like TikTok Shop for the unauthorized use of customer information in scams is a complex issue that involves consumer protection laws, data privacy laws, and the specific terms and conditions set by the platform.

#### Data Privacy Act of 2012

The primary law governing the protection of personal information in the Philippines is the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). Under this law, any entity that collects, stores, or processes personal data is considered a "personal information controller" or "personal information processor." These entities are required to implement appropriate measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

If an online shopping platform fails to protect customer information, leading to its unauthorized use in a scam, the platform may be held liable for violating the Data Privacy Act. This could include administrative penalties imposed by the National Privacy Commission (NPC), as well as potential civil liabilities to the affected customers.

#### Consumer Act of the Philippines

The Consumer Act of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7394) provides additional protection to consumers, particularly against deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable sales practices. If an online shopping platform is found to have facilitated or failed to prevent a scam involving the unauthorized use of customer information, the platform could potentially be held liable under this law. 

The law mandates that businesses, including online platforms, exercise due diligence in ensuring that their operations do not lead to consumer harm. This includes safeguarding personal information and promptly addressing any breaches that could result in fraudulent activities.

#### Platform's Terms and Conditions

In many cases, the liability of an online shopping platform may also be influenced by the terms and conditions that users agree to when they sign up for the service. These terms often include clauses that limit the platform's liability for third-party actions, including unauthorized use of personal information. However, such clauses may not absolve the platform of liability if it is found to have been negligent in protecting customer data or in preventing scams.

#### Conclusion

In summary, while online shopping platforms in the Philippines may attempt to limit their liability through terms and conditions, they are still subject to the Data Privacy Act and the Consumer Act. If a platform is found to have been negligent in protecting customer information, leading to its unauthorized use in a scam, it could face legal consequences. Customers who believe their information was used without authorization should report the matter to the National Privacy Commission and consider seeking legal advice on possible remedies.
