<p>Cyber libel is a serious offense in the Philippines, governed by the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). The law applies to acts committed by Filipinos regardless of their location, meaning that a cyber libel case can be filed in the Philippines even if both the complainant and the suspect are abroad.</p><p>For such cases, the complainant can coordinate with the Philippine Embassy or Consulate in their country of residence to file a complaint. It is essential to gather evidence, such as screenshots and witness testimonies, to support the case. The complaint will then be processed through the proper channels, potentially leading to a warrant of arrest or other legal actions.</p><p>Given the complexities of international cases, it is advisable to seek legal counsel in both the country of residence and the Philippines to ensure that all legal procedures are correctly followed.</p>
