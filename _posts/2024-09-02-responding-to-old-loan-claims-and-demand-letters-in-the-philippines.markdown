<p>Receiving a demand letter from a bank or creditor for an old loan can be alarming, especially when the debt is from many years ago and has accumulated significant interest and fees. In the Philippines, loans and other financial obligations generally have a prescriptive period, which is the time limit within which a creditor can legally pursue a claim in court. For written contracts like loans, this period is typically ten years from the date the obligation becomes due, as per the Civil Code of the Philippines.</p><p>If a demand letter is received after this period, the debtor may invoke the prescription of the action as a defense, meaning the creditor may no longer have the legal right to collect the debt through court action. However, it is crucial to respond to the demand letter promptly, preferably through a formal reply stating the invocation of the prescription period, and requesting that the claim be withdrawn.</p><p>If the prescriptive period has not yet lapsed, it is advisable to verify the legitimacy of the debt. The debtor should request a detailed statement of account from the creditor, showing the principal amount, interest, and any other charges applied over time. If there is any discrepancy or if the debtor genuinely has no knowledge of the loan, further investigation is necessary. Engaging the services of a lawyer can provide guidance on how to proceed, particularly if there is a threat of legal action.</p><p>Ignoring a demand letter is not recommended, as it may lead to legal consequences, including the filing of a case in court. Addressing the issue directly and seeking legal counsel can help resolve the matter appropriately and possibly negotiate a settlement if necessary.</p>
