<p>Fraudulent inducement of employment occurs when an employer makes false representations to a prospective employee, leading them to accept a job offer under false pretenses. In the Philippines, this practice is considered unlawful and can have serious legal consequences for the employer.</p><p>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, specifically under provisions related to employment contracts, employers are required to provide truthful information about the terms and conditions of employment. If an employee is induced to enter into employment based on fraudulent representations, they may have the right to rescind the contract and claim damages.</p><p>Employees who have been victims of fraudulent inducement may file a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). DOLE has the authority to investigate such cases and impose penalties on employers found guilty of such practices. In addition to administrative remedies, employees may also pursue civil actions for damages resulting from the fraudulent inducement.</p><p>The law also protects employees from being unfairly dismissed if they resign after discovering the fraud. Resigning under such circumstances does not constitute abandonment, and employees may still be entitled to separation benefits, depending on the case.</p><p>Given the potential legal repercussions, employers are advised to ensure transparency and honesty during the recruitment process. Accurate representation of job roles, compensation, benefits, and working conditions is not only a legal obligation but also a critical aspect of maintaining trust and integrity in the workplace.</p>
